<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has actually happened in systems which contain gases and liquids.

<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its normal circulation. IRWD's potable water supply is designed to keep the water streaming to you.

This creates a backflow condition and the potential for infected water going into the safe and clean water circulation system.</p>
<p>Gas line leakages are a severe safety concern. Do not take any chances. Ensure the softener is set to the firmness of your water system.

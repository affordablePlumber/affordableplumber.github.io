<h3>Kitchen Sink Repair in Trenton New Jersey</h2>

<p>Checking the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and check if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this could be serious problem if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your home should have water. This goes for every other turned off valve and their corresponding faucets. If everything is working correctly, you are off to a good start.</p>

<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a quick fix in the short-term, it can trigger even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time.

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water system and private on-site water system and circulation systems by forbiding cross-connections between potable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of defense for the public water supply system.</p>

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to work with a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair bill might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>

<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

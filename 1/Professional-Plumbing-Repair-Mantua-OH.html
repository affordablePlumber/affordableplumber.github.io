If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

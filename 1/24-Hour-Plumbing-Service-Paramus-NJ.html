<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Paramus NJ</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If you have a big bathtub or more that two bathrooms, this style hot water heater may make the most sense for you. There are some installation considerations, particularly around sizing the gas line and setting up the flue vent, but with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to produce more hot water than a standard 80-gallon tank, these things are pretty special. High-efficiency storage is a fantastic alternative for area heating hydronic options too.</p>

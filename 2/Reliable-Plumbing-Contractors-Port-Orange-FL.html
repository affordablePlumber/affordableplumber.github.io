This device includes no less than five individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline.

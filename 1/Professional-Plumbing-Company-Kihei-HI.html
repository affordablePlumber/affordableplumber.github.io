<p>No other room in a house contains as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned up and examined the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now all set to begin the re-assembly process. Some models require the components to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Lots of parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each element is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the appropriate location. It is also essential that as they are placed back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the components or inadvertently put in the body. The parts should be positioned so that the guides have the ability to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

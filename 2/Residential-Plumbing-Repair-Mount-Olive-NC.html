<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.

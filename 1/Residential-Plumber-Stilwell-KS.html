That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

The CareSoft ® system was established with the same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that delivers high-performance hardness removal you can depend on for years to come.</p>

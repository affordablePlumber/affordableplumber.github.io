<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Jacksonville TX</h3>
<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations based on water damage. Adequate drainage should also be offered.</p>

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it should be much less water.</p>

<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Santa Clara CA</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leakages. If you do have frequent leaks, we discover that repiping can actually be the cheaper and better long-term option.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- typically salt. The outcome is water that's been successfully softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>

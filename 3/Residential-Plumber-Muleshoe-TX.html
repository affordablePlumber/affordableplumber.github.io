<p>No other room in a home contains as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned up and inspected the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now all set to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some designs need the components to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each component is returned into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the right area.

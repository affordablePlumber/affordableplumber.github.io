Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>

Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<p>For gas lines that should be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe should be used that is coated with an unique plastic material that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is easily noticeable from underground water lines, and also due to the fact that the plastic coating in fact protects the pipe much better than a galvanized covering would.</p>
<p>Turn on the gas and check connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. Clean the joints dry when ended up. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work.

<p>Rather of drudging large trenches to access your underground sewage system, Roto-Rooter service technicians will drill simply a few holes to see where the sewer line issue is and address it rapidly.

<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it could wreak unwanted problems on your home. A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

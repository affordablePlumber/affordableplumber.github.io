<p>Once you have actually found the journey lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

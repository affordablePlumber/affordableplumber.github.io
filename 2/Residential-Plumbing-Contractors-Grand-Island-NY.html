From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do all of it. Move the brand-new water heater into location, recut or extend the old tubing to satisfy the brand-new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings. Balance out the lines as needed with pairs of 45-degree elbows if the tubing doesn't line up.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if suitable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in.

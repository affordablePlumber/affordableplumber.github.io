<p>In water system systems, water is normally kept at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

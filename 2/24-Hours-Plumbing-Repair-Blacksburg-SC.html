<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

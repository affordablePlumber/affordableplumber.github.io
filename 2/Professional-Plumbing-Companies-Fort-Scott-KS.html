<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is also serves as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Examiner for the group. Howard, the Project Manager, has actually constantly been valuable and helpful concerning all our issues. He did the proposition and arranged the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair quickly. It is constantly a satisfaction to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is constantly pleasant, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

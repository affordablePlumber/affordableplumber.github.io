<p>A second part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dosage, water firmness, and washing temperature level to see if hardness had an influence on detergent cost savings. The research study consisted of tests that removed difficult soils, in addition to evaluating shooting and spotting. Researchers discovered that softened water uses almost 30% less detergent, but cleans as well as water at 10 gpg firmness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent savings rises to nearly 70%.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater.

<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on three various events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home.

<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or broken, it might wreak unwelcome problems on your property. A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

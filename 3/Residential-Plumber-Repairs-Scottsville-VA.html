<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to split and harden or merely be so squished that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

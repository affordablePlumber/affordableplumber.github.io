New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad odor and taste. It gets rid of the mineral content to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes excellent when you add a water softener.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are thought about a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be indicated on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and then annually.</p>
<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can create sound. If your energy bills are increasing, a brand-new, greater efficiency hot water heater can bring them pull back. All that needs to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting tough water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new place and placed there.</p>

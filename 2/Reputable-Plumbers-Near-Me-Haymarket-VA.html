<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

In some cases conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your business, they can cause financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your business completely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a little office the problems triggered by even little drain problems can trigger significant problems.</p>

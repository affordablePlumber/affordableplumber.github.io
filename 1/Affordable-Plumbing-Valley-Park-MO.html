<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our rigid trust certification requirements. A great guideline is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and rusted parts make repairs expensive and challenging, meaning a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>

So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work.

<p>106.11.4.2 Written Test. The applicant will be needed to pass a composed test proper to the proposed plumbing work. The test will include questions about general trade knowledge of plumbing and basic code requirements.

<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your business, they can trigger financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your organisation completely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a little workplace the problems brought on by even little drain problems can cause major problems.</p>
<p>Testing must be completed by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor should possess a legitimate, current plumbing license, present insurance, backflow preventer testing certification, and currently adjusted test set. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>

However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens.

An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>

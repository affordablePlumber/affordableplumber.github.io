<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure.

They are very educated, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely recommend them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>

<p>Leakages are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to examine.

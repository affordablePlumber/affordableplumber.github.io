Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many big cities need several aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>

Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That implies you need to cut off the extending ends later on with a hacksaw.

<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Central SC</h3>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is by hand manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the professional to accurately examine conditions and diagnose the functionality of the pipes. The details we obtain from the inspection permits us to make an informed choice concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the best service too. We can make the ideal suggestion with self-confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned up of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin.</p>

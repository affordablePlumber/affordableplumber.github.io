Do not be confused by the labels FIP and MIP; they merely represent female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you buy the parts, don't be reluctant to ask for help. Then screw all the gas line parts together to make certain they fit.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill might be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>

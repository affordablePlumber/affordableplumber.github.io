<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned.

That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

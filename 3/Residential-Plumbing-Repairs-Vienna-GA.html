<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

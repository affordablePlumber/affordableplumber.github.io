<p>Leakages are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure.

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time related. If whatever is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the overall costs. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>

A climatic vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc rises and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to allow air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is intact and tight, without any signs of leakage, you can most likely leave it in place. Possibilities are good that the mounting brackets on the new unit will fit simply fine. To discover, eliminate the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>

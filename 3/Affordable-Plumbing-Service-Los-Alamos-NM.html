<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Los Alamos NM 87544</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

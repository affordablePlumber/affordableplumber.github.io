<p>Carbon monoxide gas is released when gas burns incompletely. The symptoms are the exact same as exposure to gas leak. The exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so deadly that anyone who inhales it needs instant medical attention.

To prevent this disaster, ensure to use your gas stoves exactly as instructed and never to use them to warm your house.

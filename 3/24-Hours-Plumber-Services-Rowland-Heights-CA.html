The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health danger or health threat conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system..

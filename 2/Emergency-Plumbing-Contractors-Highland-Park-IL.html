<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair in Highland Park Illinois</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have achieved a breakthrough in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) innovation. SACr physically eliminates temporary hardness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant constraints of current softening innovations.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

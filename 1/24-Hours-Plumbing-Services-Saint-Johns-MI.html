<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Saint Johns MI</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

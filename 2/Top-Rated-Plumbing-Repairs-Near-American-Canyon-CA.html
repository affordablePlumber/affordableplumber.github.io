Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll find among the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

He or she will make sure pipes have anti-freeze protection in place if you live an area where temperatures go listed below freezing. More handy homeowners might wish to deal with garbage disposal problems by themselves. However, if you wish to ensure a precise repair or installation, call our licensed plumbers for help.</p>

This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

Please call our Building Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any questions about what is needed for each inspection or if you need help scheduling an inspection.

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and changed with new rubber parts. It is necessary that just initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>

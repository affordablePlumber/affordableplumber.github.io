<p>Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Changing your flapper might need somewhat different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however chances are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

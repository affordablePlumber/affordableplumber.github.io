<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

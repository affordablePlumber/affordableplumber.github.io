<p>Examine the washer for wear or cracks when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. But discovering the ideal washer may not be. The most typical washers are frequently readily available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to find.

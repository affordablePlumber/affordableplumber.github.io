As hard water passes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger difficult water adhere to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>

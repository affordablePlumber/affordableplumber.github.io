Our plumbers are certified to repair or replace a toilet that is not working appropriately. We are geared up to work with many brand names such as American Standard & Kohler.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

<p>The easiest way to keep you and your family safe from the potential threats of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>

Then, our service technician will dig to find the gas line and leak. The gas line will be replaced and pressure evaluated to ensure there are no leaks.

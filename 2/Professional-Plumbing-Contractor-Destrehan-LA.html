<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you have actually found the journey lever you desire remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method. When you've protected the journey lever and are all set to connect your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>

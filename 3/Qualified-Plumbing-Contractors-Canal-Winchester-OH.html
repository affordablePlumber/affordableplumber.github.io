In time, dirt, debris, hair, and countless other little particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water might not have the ability to drain rapidly or effectively, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously supporting. It might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this happens.</p>

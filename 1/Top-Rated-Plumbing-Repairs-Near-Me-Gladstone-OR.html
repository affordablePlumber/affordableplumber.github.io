<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for house plumbing.

A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.

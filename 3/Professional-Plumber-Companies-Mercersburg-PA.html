And if your house is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly developed to be used with a septic tank. gives a summary 1 of garbage disposals and septic tanks.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi).

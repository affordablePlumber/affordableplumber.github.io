<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>

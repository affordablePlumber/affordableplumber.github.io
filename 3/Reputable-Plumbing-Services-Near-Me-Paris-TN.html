<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing company. Identify the size of the water pipes in the home and around the house - they will help to figure out the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in size to provide adequate flow.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health danger if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>

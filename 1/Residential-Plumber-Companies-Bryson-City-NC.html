<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it could wreak unwanted issues on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (likewise known as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>A continuous-feed waste disposal unit is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating big quantities of food waste. The majority of garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is safer to have a vibrating unit come unplugged then detached from fixed electrical wiring. However, some sinks do not have a plug-in installed below, and it might take an electrical contractor and even permits to get one set up on its own dedicated circuit.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>

<p>Maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from proficient plumbing specialists when you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair. Backflow prevention devices run by permitting water to flow in just one instructions. In an unprotected water service connection, drinkable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may stream backwards into the drinkable water supply. To safeguard water quality, backflow defense is needed where the end user presents a threat of polluting the city's water supply.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year.

<p>Most houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition defense. As the outer coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

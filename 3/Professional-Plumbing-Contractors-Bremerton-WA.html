<p>Think of all the areas water streams in and out of your house. These are the areas that a professional evaluation should cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines ought to be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will receive unique attention, a skilled plumber looks to take a look at the complete health of your system. That indicates testing for correct water pressure. After all, too much pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water devices.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper may need somewhat different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

You might not discover a similar match, however opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>

<p>Tough water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually experiences deterioration and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

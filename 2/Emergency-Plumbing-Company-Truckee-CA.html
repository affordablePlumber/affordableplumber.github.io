<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

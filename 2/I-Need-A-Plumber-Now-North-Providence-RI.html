<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your home effectively eliminate large quantities of water and waste. Gradually, dirt, debris, hair, and many other little particles can get caught and build up in your pipes.

It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate when this takes place.</p>

When individuals think about cleaning their drains, their minds generally leap to the conclusion that the drain is clogged. This is not always the only factor that requires drain cleaning, although it is a typical sign of drain trouble.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical option, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>

<p>Plastic pipe is in wide usage for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to produce up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a technique to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and was in wide usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

When this happens, homeowners and plumbers need to have the ability to clear out their drainage pipes. Buildings without sufficient cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at danger of a pipe bursting.</p>

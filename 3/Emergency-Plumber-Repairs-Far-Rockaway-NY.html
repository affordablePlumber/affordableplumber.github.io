Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may stream in reverse into the potable water system.

<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines.

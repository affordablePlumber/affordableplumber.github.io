The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

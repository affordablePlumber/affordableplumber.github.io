<p>Current Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up during the designated time period. They unplugged the sinks, cleaned up and recommended a tool to be utilized in the future. How do you know if it's time to call for sewer line repair or replacement? Watch out for numerous clogged drains in your home, overflowing or backed up toilets, or water stains on your walls and structure.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The average time to replace a garbage or install disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.

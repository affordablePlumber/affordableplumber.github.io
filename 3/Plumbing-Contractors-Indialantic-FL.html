<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>

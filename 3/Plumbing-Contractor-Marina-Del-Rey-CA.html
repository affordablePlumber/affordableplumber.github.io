<p>The anode rod in your water heater is created to bring in corrosion-causing elements in the water, helping to avoid the steel tank from corroding. The very best way to avoid drain blockages is to enjoy what you flush.

Wearing away pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't currently) and need to be replaced as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Some pipe materials are more affordable than others; some are more brittle and vulnerable to breaking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are vulnerable to rust and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe products have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and stress as an outcome of temperature change and ice development.

The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will trigger your water to look brown or rusty, and the water may have a bad or nasty smell to it.

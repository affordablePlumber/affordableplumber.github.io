A copy of the test report should be offered to us.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does occur regularly than you think! Typically it takes place during the night when you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.

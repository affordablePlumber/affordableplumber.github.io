<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>

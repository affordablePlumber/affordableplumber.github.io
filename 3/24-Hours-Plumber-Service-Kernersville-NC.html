<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these little deposits are safe, however over time they build up and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>You might have heard stories about a hot water heater blowing up inside a home or organisation! It is very important to comprehend that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your hot water heater can turn your hot water heater into a hazardous time bomb. The age of your water heater. A standard tank hot water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before requiring a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last as much as 20 with proper maintenance and care. It might be best for your long-lasting costs to replace it now if your system is getting up there in age.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>

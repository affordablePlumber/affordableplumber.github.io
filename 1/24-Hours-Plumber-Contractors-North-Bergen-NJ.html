<p>If you notice an odor or unpleasant smell originating from your unit, which is not uncommon, consider buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can escape. These flanges are easy and commonly offered to install, costing around $30 in the house improvement or hardware shops. Turn off the supply of water to your house at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing throughout the installation process, shut down the water system to your house. Ensure your water heater's water system is shut off, as is the electrical energy running to the system.</p>

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
<p>Applications range from softening in remote areas to dealing with issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given up horse power, or HP.

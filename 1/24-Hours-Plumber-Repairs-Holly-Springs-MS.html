<p>Sadly, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes corrosive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main cause of the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>
<p>Drains clog with time. In kitchens, greases, soaps and more develop on the walls of the pipes and trigger an obstruction. In restrooms, showers, tubs and sinks become clogged with hair and soap, and toilets can become clogged with toilet tissue.

<h3>Plumbing Video Camera Inspection in Wahiawa Hawaii</h2>
<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to damage from corrosion and may place toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your home.

<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Wahiawa HI</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

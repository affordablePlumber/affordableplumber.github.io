<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

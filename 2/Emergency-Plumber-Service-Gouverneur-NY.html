It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>

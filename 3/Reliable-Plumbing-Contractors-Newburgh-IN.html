<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Due to the fact that copper is showing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes, just. You might need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>

<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

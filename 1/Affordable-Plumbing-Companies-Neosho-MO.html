<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Company in Neosho</h2>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

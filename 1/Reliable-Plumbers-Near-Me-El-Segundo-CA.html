<p>We're replacing a natural gas water heater in our demonstration. The actions for replacing a propane hot water heater are precisely the very same, and those for an electrical water heater are similar. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we advise replacing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>

Difficult water normally leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become quite unpleasant.

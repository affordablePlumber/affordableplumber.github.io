<p>As is the case with any plumbing device or water treatment system, your water softener need to be expertly installed and serviced. This is the only way to make sure that your system can manage the need of your household, and that it will actually do the job successfully. Maintenance requirements are minimal, however it does pay to have the system inspected for proper operation routinely.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>

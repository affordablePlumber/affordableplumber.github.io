<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in locations where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Plastic pipe remains in large usage for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being practical to produce until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a technique to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and remained in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have actually ended up being increasingly common, with a range of fittings and products used.</p>

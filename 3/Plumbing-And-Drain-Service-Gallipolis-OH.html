<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

<p>Like the majority of household appliances, your water heater is one of those things that gets considered given - till it goes kaput. Then it garners all the attention it deserves. Usually, the lifespan of a lot of water heaters is in between ten and fifteen years. Obviously, this lifespan varies according to the frequency of use and care and maintenance. Understanding when it's time for water heater repair permits you to make informed decisions and make sure a continuous supply of clean, safe hot water.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>

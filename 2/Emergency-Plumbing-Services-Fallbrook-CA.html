<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day.

This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

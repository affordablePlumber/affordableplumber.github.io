<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exemptions in Section 106.2.2 will be applicable to minor repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings other than Group R-3 tenancies, an authorization and inspection will be needed for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor wing, area, or level is involved, even though the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (nominal) of the overall building plumbing.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>

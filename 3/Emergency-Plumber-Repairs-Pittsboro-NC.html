<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>This may seem like a joke, however it's very serious if you wish to genuinely get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection list. If you're getting a rough-in or final inspection on a construction job or remodel, you can do a little online research study so you can make final adjustments prior to inspection day. Failing a checkup can indicate undesirable delays in your task.</p>

<p>When you have actually discovered the trip lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you've protected the journey lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>

<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

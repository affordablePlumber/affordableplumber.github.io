<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Fort Myers FL 33908</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

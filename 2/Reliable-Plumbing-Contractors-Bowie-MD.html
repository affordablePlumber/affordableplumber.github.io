<p>We're replacing a gas hot water heater in our presentation. The steps for replacing a propane water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electrical hot water heater are similar. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>

A small cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.

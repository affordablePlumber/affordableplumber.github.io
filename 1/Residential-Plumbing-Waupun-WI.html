<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were fantastic. They quickly found the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, as with everyone we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and really well-informed. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either big or small task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Gas lines can be dangerous, and it's constantly best to tackle any problems with the help of a professional. House owners must never try to fix a gas line by themselves. One little error can trigger a fire or an explosion. There's no need to position everyone under your roof in risk and expose them to a potentially devastating scenario. Constantly hire the assistance of a professional.</p>

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically two layers of defense. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong method. There are 2 different kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on a certification test, I discuss them just.</p>

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

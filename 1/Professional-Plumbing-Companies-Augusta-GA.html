<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and particles and can fail to carry water from roofing system rain gutters far from your house or service when not correctly preserved. Even if you take good care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, often blockages are inevitable.

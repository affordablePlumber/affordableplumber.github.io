<p>Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is an essential kitchen device in many homes today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can deal with almost any kind of food waste, they are not unbreakable.

Worn impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the danger of drain blockages.</p>

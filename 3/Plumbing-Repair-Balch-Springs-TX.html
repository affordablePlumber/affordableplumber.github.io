PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

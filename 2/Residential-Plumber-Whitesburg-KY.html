<p>Seeking to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Many obstructions are triggered by putting excessive toilet tissue into the bowl.

<p>Blending vaporized salt with rock salt is not advised, as this could clog the softening reservoir. It is recommended that you allow your system to go empty of one kind of salt prior to including another to prevent the incident of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you need a license, call your local department of inspections and ask.

<p>The actual procedure of installing a disposal must be made with caution. There are dangers involved since you are handling blades, electricity, and water.

<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Tupelo MS</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

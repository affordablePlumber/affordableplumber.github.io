<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and counts on a great balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers end up being frustrating, or it appears little to no water is draining of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. The cost depends on the size of the house and the number of restrooms and plumbing fixtures-- utility room, damp bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to gain access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your final costs.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>

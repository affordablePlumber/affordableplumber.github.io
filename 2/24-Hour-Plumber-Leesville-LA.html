<p>If you observe an odor or unpleasant smell coming from your unit, which is not uncommon, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can escape. These flanges are extensively readily available and simple to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware stores. Turn off the water supply to your house at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing during the installation process, shut down the supply of water to your house. Ensure your hot water heater's water system is switched off, as is the electrical energy going to the unit.</p>

<p>A recently installed water heater should not produce strange sounds, but it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things intensify significantly for households with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be needed.</p>

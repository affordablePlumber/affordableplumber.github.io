Most of the times, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>When a plumbing authorization has been issued in error since of incorrect, incorrect or incomplete details, or the work for which the license was released breaks the Uniform Code, such license shall be withdrawed or suspended till such time as the license holder demonstrates that all work completed and all work proposed shall be in compliance with suitable provisions of the code.</p>

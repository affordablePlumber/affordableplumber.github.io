<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

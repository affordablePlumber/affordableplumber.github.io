<p>Leakages are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

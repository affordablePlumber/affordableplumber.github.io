<p>2 styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB may be used to isolate health or non-health risks but works versus back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had numerous plumbing leaks repaired and couldn't be better with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really well-informed, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely advise them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>

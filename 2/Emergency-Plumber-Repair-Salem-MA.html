<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Salem MA</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and regular leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leakages, we discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-lasting option.</p>

These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>

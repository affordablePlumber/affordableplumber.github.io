<p>In the 1990 ′ s, dry spell conditions inspired water providers to carry out water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs.

Constant blockages indicate your toilet no longer has the power needed to effectively get rid of waste with each flush.</p>

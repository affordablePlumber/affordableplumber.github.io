<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally sodium or often potassium).</p>

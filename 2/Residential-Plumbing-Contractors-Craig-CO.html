<p>The pipes in your house are accountable for supplying you with water for many of your everyday activities.

<p>Depending upon the degree of the clog, we may use a range of various methods, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced form of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to completely clear out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and eliminate wire adapters. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp connector and eliminate wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>Understand that many types of disposals need a switch adjacent to the sink to manage the outlet-- the electrician needs to wire for this, too. Keep in mind: Batch-feed disposers do not need a switch because they begin when you place and turn a special drain plug. The purpose of the plumbing code is to guarantee the correct installation of systems for furnishing drinkable water, for hygienic sewage disposal and storm drainage; and to insure public safety, health, and welfare insofar as affected by the installation of plumbing.</p>

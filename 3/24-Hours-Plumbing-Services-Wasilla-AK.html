<p>Sewer lines have one important function: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive alternative.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again crucial for the repair service technician to be knowledgeable about the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning process is not damaging. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to reduce any scale growth or deterioration. It is important that the repair service technician is sensitive to the hardness and kind of the various coverings used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective covering.</p>

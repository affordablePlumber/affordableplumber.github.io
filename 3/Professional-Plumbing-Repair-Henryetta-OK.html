<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>

Because they don't like the technology and not due to the fact that it does not work, will likewise state something doesn't work well just. The piping process adds to the installation costs if this heater is set up in a home with several restrooms.</p>

<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Nanticoke PA</h3>
<p>Many houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away.

Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the external finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>

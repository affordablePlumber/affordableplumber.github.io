<p>Some water heater problems are minor enough to be efficiently addressed with professional repairs. Things like a dark pilot burner, tripped breaker, broken burner, or sediment accumulation are all reasonably low-cost and simple to attend to. However, certain problems with your water heater might indicate that it's time for a replacement. Our Wheaton plumbers can assist you determine which strategy is best for you.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>

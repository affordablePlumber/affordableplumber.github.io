<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater replacement, maintenance or repair, you can expect professional service from proficient plumbing experts. Backflow prevention gadgets run by allowing water to stream in only one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, potable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture.

For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from cars and truck washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement might flow backwards into the drinkable water system.

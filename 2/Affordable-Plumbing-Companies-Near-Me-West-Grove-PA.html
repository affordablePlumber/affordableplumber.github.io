Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.

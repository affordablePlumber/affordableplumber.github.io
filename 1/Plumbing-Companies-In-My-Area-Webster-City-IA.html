<p>Dual Inspect Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Check Valve or double backflow prevention valve is generally a stripped down Check Valve without turned off valves and test cocks. They are non-testable and are generally utilized by public utility and set up after a water meter to avoid the meter from running in reverse and low protection versus backflow. This piece of equipment is the center of controversy with many backflow authorities and must never be puzzled with Check Valves.

<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Webster City IA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Also called cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we turn on our end to unclog drains. This method works best for cleaning out drains clogged with hair and debris, such as sinks and showers. Backflow is the circulation of water in the wrong direction from a consumer's water system into the general public water system. Backflow may be caused by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>

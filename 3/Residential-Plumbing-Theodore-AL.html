Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

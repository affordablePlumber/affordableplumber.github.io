When it's time for replacement, here's how to examine your plumbing system and know.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers need to be able to raise and move heavy tools and products. Tip: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the inside. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible choice.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>

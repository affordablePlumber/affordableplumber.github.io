In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

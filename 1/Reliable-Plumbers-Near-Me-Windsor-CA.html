<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off.

The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>

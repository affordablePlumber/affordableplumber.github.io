<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each part. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of constant or direct) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

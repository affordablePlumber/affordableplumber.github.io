In general, older water heaters (over 8-10 years) experiencing repeating problems are much better off being changed. A more recent, more effective hot water heater will save you in repair expenses and energy in time. Old-fashioned water softeners are well-known for causing a spike in the price of your month-to-month energy costs.

<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Farmington MN</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>We take care to ensure that it is done correctly without any leakages that could cause water damage in the long-run when we install a new sink. Our group can assist you with that too if your kitchen has already suffered from water damage and the resulting repercussions of mildew, mold, and rot. We can even repair or install a brand new garbage disposal so your kitchen is not only beautiful, however it is functional too.</p>

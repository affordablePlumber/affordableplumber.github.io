<p>These valves have a great deal of flexibility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention choices, however they likewise supply the least amount of defense. A climatic vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc seals and rises off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>

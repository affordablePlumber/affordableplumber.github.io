<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Correct care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>

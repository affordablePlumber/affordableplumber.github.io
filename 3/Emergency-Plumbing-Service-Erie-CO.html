<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters must have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Tip: Location a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are degrading gradually from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only viable alternative.</p>

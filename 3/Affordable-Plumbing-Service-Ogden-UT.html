<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were fantastic. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a substantial mess.

<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>

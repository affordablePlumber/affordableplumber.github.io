The majority of the Valley in fact has a few of the worst water in the nation. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the country according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do reside in a desert after all. In reality the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even drink has a chlorine level that is ideal for swimming pools.

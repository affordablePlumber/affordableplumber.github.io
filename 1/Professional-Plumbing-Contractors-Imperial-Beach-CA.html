<p>Dual Check Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is generally a stripped down Check Valve without shut down valves and test dicks. They are non-testable and are normally utilized by water companies and installed after a water meter to prevent the meter from running in reverse and low protection against backflow.

<p>Your sewer line is among the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it might wreak unwelcome problems on your home. A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair bill might be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater.</p>

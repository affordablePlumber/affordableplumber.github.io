If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

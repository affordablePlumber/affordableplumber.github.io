<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure proper backflow prevention remains in place to protect our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send a testing pointer notification 30 days prior to the yearly test is due.</p>
<p>Next, recognize that unless your water is extremely hard, all the incoming water does not need to be softened.

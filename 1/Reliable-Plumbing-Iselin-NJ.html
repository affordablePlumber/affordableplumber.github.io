<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a destructive effect on your organisation. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience much more use and tear than residential drains and are more prone to clogs and obstruction. All backflow preventers should be tested every year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report should be offered to us.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Rust can literally consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or alter the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. If the part is usable or need to be replaced, the effect of deterioration on a metal alloy should be evaluated to determine.</p>
<p>Testing should be finished by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control workplace. The contractor must possess a legitimate, updated plumbing license, existing insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing certification, and presently adjusted test package. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>

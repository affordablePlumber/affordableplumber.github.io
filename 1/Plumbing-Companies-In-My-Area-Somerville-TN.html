<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with negative pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

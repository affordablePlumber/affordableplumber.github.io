<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Kankakee IL</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

<p>Leakages are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are looked for appropriate grading to keep downward circulation. The plumbing system is tested for leaks. We check that the material utilized in the plumbing system is approved by an acknowledged testing lab.

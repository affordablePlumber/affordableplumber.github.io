Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

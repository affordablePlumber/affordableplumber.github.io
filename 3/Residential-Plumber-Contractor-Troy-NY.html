<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The law also requires annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report sent to the DEP. Failure to comply can result in penalties and termination of water service. Since backflow preventer gadgets are comprised of moving springs, seals, and parts and are subject to destructive compounds, wear, and fatigue, it's critical to effectively keep them to guarantee they appropriately run and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>

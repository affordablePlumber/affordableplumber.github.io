Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.

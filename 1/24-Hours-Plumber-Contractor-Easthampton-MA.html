<p>While this may seem like an issue with your faucet, it's generally brought on by something else - like a plumbing concern or issue with your water heater. More and more individuals are selling their old water heaters for new, tankless variations. Whether you're seeking to increase your house's eco-friendliness or simply plain tired of lacking hot water, a tankless water heater might be the best solution for you.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>

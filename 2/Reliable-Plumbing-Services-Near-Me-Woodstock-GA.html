<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET offered by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as most plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>

<p>Leakages are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

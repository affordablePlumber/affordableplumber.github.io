Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

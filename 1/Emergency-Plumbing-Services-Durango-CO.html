<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>

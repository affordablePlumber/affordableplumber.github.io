<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

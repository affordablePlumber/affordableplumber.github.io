<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, commonly known as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to obtain consistency among the different jurisdictions within the State; reduce the building's energy and water usage; lower waste; and decrease the carbon footprint.

If this heater is set up in a home with multiple restrooms, the piping procedure adds to the installation expenses.</p>

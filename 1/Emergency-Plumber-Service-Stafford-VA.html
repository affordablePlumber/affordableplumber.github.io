<p>Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water system within a building these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed.

Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>

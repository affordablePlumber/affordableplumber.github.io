<p>This article intends to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a properly configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a few complicated truths that often lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally destructive.

Beyond bodily harm, gas line leakages can also trigger extreme damage to your pipes, indicating more of your hard-earned money spent on repairs.</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing strategies are not required for one- and two-family homes or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>

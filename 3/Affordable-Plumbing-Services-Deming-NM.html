But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.

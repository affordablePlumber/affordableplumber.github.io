<h3>Fast Emergency Plumbers Near Me Maxton NC</h3>
<p>Think of all the areas water flows in and out of your house. These are the locations that a professional assessment ought to cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines should be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will receive special attention, a knowledgeable plumber looks to examine the complete health of your system. That means testing for correct water pressure. After all, excessive pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water appliances.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

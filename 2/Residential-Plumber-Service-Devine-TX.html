You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot.

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

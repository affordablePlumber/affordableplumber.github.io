<p>Most homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>

<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner set. The total repair costs may be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Dexter MI 48130!</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

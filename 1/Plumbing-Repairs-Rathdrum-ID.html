<p>PEX is made from a versatile piping material that is economical and easy to install and is resistant to acidic compounds.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

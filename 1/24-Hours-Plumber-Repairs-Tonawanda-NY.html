<h3>Broken Toilet in Tonawanda New York</h2>
<p>Your house's drains and pipes quietly remove countless gallons of wastewater from your home every year without you even giving them a reservation. However, when hair, food scraps, feminine health products, toys, and other foreign objects make their method into your drains, they can lead to severe problems. While often it's apparent you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is totally stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for instance), it can sometimes be more difficult to inform if you have a problem on your hands.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

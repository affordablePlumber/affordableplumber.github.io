<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really pushes into the clog, working further into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were allowed to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the house. Generally, the water supply to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>

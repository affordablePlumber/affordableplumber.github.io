<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Many kitchen sink clogs are because of heavy grease accumulation and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the garbage and use the disposal for the small particles that are left. Run cold water while running the disposal and you can count on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains.

<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature to see if solidity had an effect on detergent cost savings. The research study included tests that got rid of hard soils, in addition to evaluating spotting and shooting. Researchers found that softened water uses practically 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up in addition to water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that detergent cost savings rises to almost 70%.</p>

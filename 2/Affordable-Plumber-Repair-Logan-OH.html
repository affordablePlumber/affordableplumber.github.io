<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Whenever you switch on a warm water tap in your home, cold water goes into the heater through a pipe.

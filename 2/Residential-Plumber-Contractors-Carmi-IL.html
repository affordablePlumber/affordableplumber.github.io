<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream might trigger a reversal in flow.</p>

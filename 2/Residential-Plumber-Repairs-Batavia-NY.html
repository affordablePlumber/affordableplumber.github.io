<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>

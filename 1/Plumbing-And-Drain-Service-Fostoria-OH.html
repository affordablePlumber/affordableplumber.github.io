<p>Surprise water leakages are often difficult and have Potentially Severe Effects. When it rains, any excess water is expected to go down a storm drain in order to avoid flooding problems. If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your residential or commercial property when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a timely way, the possibilities are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>

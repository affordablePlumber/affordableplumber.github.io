<p>Individuals who write these short articles should be considerate of the consumer and the professional provider. Do not do an injustice to these individuals by being so narrow minded in your suggestions. See all of the possibilities. Then compose a well informed post. As soon as the FutureSoft water softener is set up, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This doesn't mean it's not working.

<p>The usual solution is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>A normal gas line can cost approximately $1,000. The labor costs increase if the gas line is under a walkway, sprinkler system or trees. Drain cleaning is something that you will eventually have to handle in any home. Sinks and toilets are used every day, typically several times a day, so it's nearly unavoidable that you're eventually going to run into a clog. Now, there are many solutions to obstructions, depending upon the intensity of the blockage.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair expense might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>

Property owners can just unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method.</p>
<p>Inspect to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's causing the issue. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to ensure it's running correctly. You might need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit underneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

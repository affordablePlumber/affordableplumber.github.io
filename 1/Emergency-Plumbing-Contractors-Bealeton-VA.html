An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.

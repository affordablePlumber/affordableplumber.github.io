<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its normal flow. IRWD's drinkable water system is designed to keep the water flowing to you.

<p>Water softeners leakages are mostly caused because of a problem at the point of installation or due to the fact that of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. It can likewise cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is broken. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced with time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration processes.

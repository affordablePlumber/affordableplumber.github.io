Once the FutureSoft water softener is set up, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This does not mean it's not working.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>

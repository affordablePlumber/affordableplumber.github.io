<h3>Septic Tank Repair in Sylva North Carolina</h2>
<p>There are certain plumbers who focus on plumbing associated with house improvement and new construction. When a new house is developed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up properly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber may be a great candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more customized plumber needs to be made use of for house redesigning work.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back since he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<p>It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be supplied.</p>

<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

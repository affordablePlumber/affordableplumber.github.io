Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>

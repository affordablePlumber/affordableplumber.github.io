<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>

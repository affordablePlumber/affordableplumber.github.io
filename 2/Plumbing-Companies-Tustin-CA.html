<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

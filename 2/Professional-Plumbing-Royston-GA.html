<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Typically, the supply of water to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>

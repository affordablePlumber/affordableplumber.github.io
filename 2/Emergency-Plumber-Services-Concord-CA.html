<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation in Concord California</h2>
<p>The quality of your home's H2O matters. You don't want to fret about the troubles of difficult water, and with NuvoH2O, you no longer have to! Our tankless, natural citric acid water softener is the best-rated, salt-free water softener on the marketplace-- that's why companies like Walgreens, HGTV, Popular Science, Panda Express, and more trust us to soften their water.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>

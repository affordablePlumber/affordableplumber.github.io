<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or momentary connection in between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>A properly designed irrigation system is very important for the health of plants in a landscape but it's likewise essential for human health. A successful irrigation system keeps the water for landscapes different from drinkable drinking water, avoiding contamination that can trigger health problems. That's why a backflow preventer is a requirement on any irrigation task.</p>

An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>

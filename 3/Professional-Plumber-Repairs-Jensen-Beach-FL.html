<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any number of aspects which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank ought to have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal expansion needs to leave, thus the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. The force applied by the growth taking location when boiling the water causes the tank to split and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>

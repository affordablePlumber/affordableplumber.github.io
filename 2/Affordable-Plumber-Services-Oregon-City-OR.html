<p>These valves have a lot of versatility. They're the least pricey of the backflow prevention choices, however they also provide the least amount of security. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. When pressurized and drops to permit air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc rises and seals off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in large, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>

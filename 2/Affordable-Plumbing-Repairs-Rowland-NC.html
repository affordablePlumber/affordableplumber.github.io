<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Rowland NC</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Also note that backflow prevention is required when required, in addition to inspection of the device to ensure it's working correctly.

Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>

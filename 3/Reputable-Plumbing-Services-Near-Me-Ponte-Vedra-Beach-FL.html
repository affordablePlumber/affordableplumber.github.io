<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>

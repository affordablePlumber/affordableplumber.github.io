<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps capture moisture and sediment so that they do not enter the control unit.

The City needs backflow prevention devices to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that might enable tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These gadgets are subject to testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In a lot of cases, they are subject to periodic tests later on, too.</p>

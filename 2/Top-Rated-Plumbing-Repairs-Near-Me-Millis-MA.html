The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.

The 2 kinds of pipes that we prefer to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 really different products, but they both have amazing toughness and longevity.</p>

For gas hot water heater, a specific gas line has to be installed and a practical source of gas established.

Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method. When you've protected the journey lever and are ready to attach your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>

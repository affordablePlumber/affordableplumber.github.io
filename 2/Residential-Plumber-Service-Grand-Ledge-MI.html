<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to several types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll start to deteriorate from deterioration and might position toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest replacing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your house. This might not require completely repiping your home, since newer materials may have currently been used in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you pinpoint precisely what work needs to be done.</p>

The guidelines also require a state certified backflow professional test the backflow preventer yearly.</p>

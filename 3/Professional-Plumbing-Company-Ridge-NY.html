The minerals that cause tough water adhere to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions.

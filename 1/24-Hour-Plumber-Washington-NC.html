<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Washington NC 27889</h3>
<p>Swimming pools of septic waste. Among the more apparent outdoor signs is if you can see sewage pooling in your yard. If your lawn smells nasty and there's a puddle that simply won't go away, the issue might be a cracked main sewer line. The waste disposal unit is leaking: This is caused by a damaged hose or seal. We'll completely check your system to find the problem and perform the required repair.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>

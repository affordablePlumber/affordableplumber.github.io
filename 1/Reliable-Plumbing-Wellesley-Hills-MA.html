<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time related. If everything is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>

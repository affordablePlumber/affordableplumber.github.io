<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. If allowed to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>

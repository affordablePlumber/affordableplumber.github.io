<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water.

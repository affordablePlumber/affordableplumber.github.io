<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.

Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location should be shown on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond need to be checked upon installation and then yearly.</p>

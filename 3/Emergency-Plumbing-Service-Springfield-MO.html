The largest of these main long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable coating, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most big cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>

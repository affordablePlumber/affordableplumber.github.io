<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are saying. Since they don't like the technology and not because it does not work, will likewise state something doesn't work well merely.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.

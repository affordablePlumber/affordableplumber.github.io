<p>Hard water use might affect the performance of household devices. When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with big accumulations of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing components and build up in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, thus impacting their efficiency.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working waste disposal unit, or too much food being disposed down the drain. We will generally suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting Â® services, depending upon the intensity of the scenario. Provide us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells nasty, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
<p>Installing a hot water heater is not as simple as hooking up a number of tubes. Water heaters need space to run securely and an incorrectly installed system can be a continuous source of risk in your house. When you employ a licensed professional, you can be sure your system is installed effectively both for security, optimal performance, and optimum energy cost savings.</p>

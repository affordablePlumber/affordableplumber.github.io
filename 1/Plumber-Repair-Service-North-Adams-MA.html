<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in North Adams MA 01247?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>A Pilot Light That Has Headed out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas hot water heater instead of a system with an electric heating element, there is a likelihood your pilot light has actually gone out. This could be due to the fact that of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of combustible air, or just a strong breeze. Regardless of what the issue is, however, your hot water heater will not have the ability to function until the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three various events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were wonderful. They quickly found the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, as with everyone we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and extremely well-informed. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either little or large job plumbing work.</p>

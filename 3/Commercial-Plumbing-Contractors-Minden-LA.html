<p>PEX is made from a flexible piping product that is easy and low-cost to install and is resistant to acidic compounds.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.

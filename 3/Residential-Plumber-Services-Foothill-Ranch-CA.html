<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

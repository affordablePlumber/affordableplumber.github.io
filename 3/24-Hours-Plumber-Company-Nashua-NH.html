<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

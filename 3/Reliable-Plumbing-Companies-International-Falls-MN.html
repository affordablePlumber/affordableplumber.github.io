Even your water lines ought to be covered. While your water heater and toilets will receive unique attention, a knowledgeable plumber wants to take a look at the complete health of your system.

To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

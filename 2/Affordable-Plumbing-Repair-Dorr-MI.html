Generally, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water until it is in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange procedure to remove dissolved minerals that aren't as successfully removed by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes hard water.</p>

<p>Hard water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Though it's not always required, often the plumber might need to repair or update wiring to power the new garbage disposal. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+.

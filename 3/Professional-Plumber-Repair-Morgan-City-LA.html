<p>As a company owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a disastrous effect on your service. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and use than residential sewage systems and are more vulnerable to blockages and obstruction. All backflow preventers need to be checked yearly by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report must be offered to us.</p>
<p>All Backflow Prevention Assembly Testers (BAPTs) are needed to register with Vepo, LLC.

<p>Broken pipes become extremely more pricey to fix as the rate of the flow of the broken pipe grows. And whether residential or commercial, broken pipes can trigger leakage into the water supply, which can be a significant cause of concern and even an ecological hazard if a sewage line is included. All plumbing needs to have their tests on at the time of inspection or the plumber should certify the plumbing was tested on the test type on the right side of this page.</p>

When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>

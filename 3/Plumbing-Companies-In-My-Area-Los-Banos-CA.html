<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>All you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) as soon as you have actually found the trip lever you desire remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>

<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>

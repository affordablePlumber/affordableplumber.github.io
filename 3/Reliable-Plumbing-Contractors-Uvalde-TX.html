<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>

<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these little deposits are harmless, but in time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

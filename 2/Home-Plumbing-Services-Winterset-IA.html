<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

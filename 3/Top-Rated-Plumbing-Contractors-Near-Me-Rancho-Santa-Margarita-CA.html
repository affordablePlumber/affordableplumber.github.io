<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

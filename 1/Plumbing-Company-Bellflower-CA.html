<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Bellflower CA</h3>
<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and depends on a good balance of water pressure in order to work effectively. If your showers end up being frustrating, or it seems little to no water is draining of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

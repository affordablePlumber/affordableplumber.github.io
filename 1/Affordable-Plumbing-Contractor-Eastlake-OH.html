<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex scientific procedure, but simple to treat. It utilizes salt to eliminate minerals and smells found in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and draw in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps press difficult water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>

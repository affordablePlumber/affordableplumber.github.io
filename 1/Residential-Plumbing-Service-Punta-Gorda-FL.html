<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try at Punta Gorda FL 33950</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>

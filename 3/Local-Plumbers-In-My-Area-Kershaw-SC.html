<p>As soon as you have actually found the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping).

Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles however will waste more water and salt.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

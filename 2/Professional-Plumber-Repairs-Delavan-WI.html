<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furniture to protect them from water damage and dust during the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will just remove as much structure material as required to reach, separate, and remove the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling listed below it. If you want, you can arrange to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel.</p>

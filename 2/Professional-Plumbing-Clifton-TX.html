<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Clifton TX</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you select must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently noted should have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terminology prior to we continue with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet turned off, appropriately located test dicks, and the required elements of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each component can further be broken down into its parts. For example a very first check is a component. An element can further be broken down into its specific parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make elements, and components are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>

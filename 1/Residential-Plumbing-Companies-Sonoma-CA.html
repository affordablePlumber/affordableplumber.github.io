<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. Figure out the size of the pipes in the house and around the house - they will help to figure out the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide sufficient circulation.</p>
<p>Distribution pipes shift to even smaller sized individual service pipes, bring water to individual homes, apartment or condo shops, services and structures. Depending on demand, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches.

Private service pipelines are generally made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>

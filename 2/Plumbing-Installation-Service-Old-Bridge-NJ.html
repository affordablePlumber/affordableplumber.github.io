<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public supply of water and private on-site water supply and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections between safe and clean (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow techniques supply an increased level of defense for the general public water system system.</p>

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET provided by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>

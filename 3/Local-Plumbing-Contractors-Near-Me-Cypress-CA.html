<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Cypress CA</h3>
<p>A freshly set up water heater should not produce unusual noises, however it will start to create rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things aggravate considerably for households with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be needed.</p>

<p>A lot of need for plumbers will come from new construction and the need to repair and preserve plumbing systems in existing houses and other buildings. Work of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to adopt modifications to developing codes that require the use of fire suppression systems. It's most likely that the brand-new system will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal attached to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by removing the old drain. Many drains are connected to the sink by a large nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>

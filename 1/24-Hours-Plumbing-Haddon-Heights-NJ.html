<p>When a plumbing license has been issued in error since of incorrect, incomplete or incorrect details, or the work for which the permit was released breaches the Uniform Code, such license will be withdrawed or suspended up until such time as the authorization holder shows that all work completed and all work proposed shall remain in compliance with suitable provisions of the code.</p>

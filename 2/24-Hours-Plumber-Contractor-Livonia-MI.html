<p>If you notice an odor or unpleasant odor coming from your system, which is not uncommon, consider buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can leave. These flanges are extensively available and easy to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the supply of water to your home at the main line. To prevent leakages from springing during the installation process, shut down the water system to your house. Make certain your hot water heater's water supply is turned off, as is the electricity going to the system.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves).

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best utilized in crucial locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>

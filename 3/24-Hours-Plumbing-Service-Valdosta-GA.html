Your home is over ten years old, and you have actually never ever had the sewer and drain lines examined. Some plumbers may get professional discounts from sellers or kitchen and bath showrooms. Compare their costs with what you can find online or at home improvement shops if you need a brand-new sink or faucet. They might be getting you a much better deal</p>

Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.

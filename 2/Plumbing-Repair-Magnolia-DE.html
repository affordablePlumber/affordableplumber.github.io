<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Magnolia DE 19962</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>

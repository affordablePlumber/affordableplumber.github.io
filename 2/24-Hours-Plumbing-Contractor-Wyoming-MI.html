Backflow prevention gadgets operate by permitting water to stream in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might stream in reverse into the safe and clean water system. To secure water quality, backflow defense is required where the end user poses a threat of polluting the city's water supply.</p>

<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks online and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the sodium ions.</p>

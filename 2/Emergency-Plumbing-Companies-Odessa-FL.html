<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back.

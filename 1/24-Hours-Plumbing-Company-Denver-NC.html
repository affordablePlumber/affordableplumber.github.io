The exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anybody who inhales it needs instant medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 people died from carbon monoxide gas poisoning between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this catastrophe, make sure to use your gas stoves exactly as advised and never ever to utilize them to warm your home. The same goes for portable gas ranges, which are to be utilized outdoors just and not inside your home. When running the space-heaters, make sure somebody is awake to monitor them.

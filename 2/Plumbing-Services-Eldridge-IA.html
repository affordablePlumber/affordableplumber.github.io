I recently had to replace the hot water heater in my home and it was only 6 years of ages. Conventional water heaters with a tank must typically last 10 to 15 years. I also have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has actually not been used in more than two years. Washing dishes is my least favorite task, particularly without the help of a dishwasher.</p>

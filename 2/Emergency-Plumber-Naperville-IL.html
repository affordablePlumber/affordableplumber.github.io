<p>Discover the ideal water softener for you. One common method for a house's water supply to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread exponentially if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and polluting the general public water supply.</p>

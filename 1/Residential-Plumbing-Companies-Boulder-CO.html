<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our rigid trust certification requirements. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal rust, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and corroded parts make repairs difficult and pricey, suggesting a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>A permit is likewise required to reconnect electrical or gas service to a house. Reconnect authorizations are required if the utility has actually been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months. The permit cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection costs.

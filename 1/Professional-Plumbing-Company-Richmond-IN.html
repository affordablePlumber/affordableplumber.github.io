<p>Double Check Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Check Valve or double backflow prevention valve is essentially a stripped down Double Check Valve without shut off valves and test cocks.

Contact local authorities for required installation, as most do not recognize these as backflow prevention gadgets.</p>

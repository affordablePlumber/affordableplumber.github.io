<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>If additional remodellings are wanted, such as setting up a tankless hot water heater or expanding the water system to accommodate a remodel, this is when those additional modifications will be made.

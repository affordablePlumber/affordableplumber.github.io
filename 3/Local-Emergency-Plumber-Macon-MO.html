<p>Replacing your flapper may need slightly different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>

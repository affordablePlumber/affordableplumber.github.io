<p>In water system systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is a suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.

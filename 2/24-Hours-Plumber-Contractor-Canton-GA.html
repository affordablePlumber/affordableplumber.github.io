<p>Aiming to repair or replace your garbage disposal? Numerous blockages are triggered by putting excessive toilet paper into the bowl. Know how much toilet tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never position any paper item into the toilet bowl other than bathroom tissue.

<p>A garbage disposal lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This typical life expectancy calculation presumes typical wear and tear of the system.

Have a drain connection or other problem that calls for a kitchen or bathroom sink repair?

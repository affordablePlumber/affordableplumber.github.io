Backflow prevention gadgets run by allowing water to flow in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, safe and clean water can stream both in and out of a building or component. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might flow backwards into the drinkable water system. To protect water quality, backflow security is needed where the end user postures a threat of contaminating the city's water system.</p>

If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be severe problem. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your house need to have water. This chooses every other shut down valve and their corresponding faucets. If whatever is working properly, you are off to an excellent start.</p>

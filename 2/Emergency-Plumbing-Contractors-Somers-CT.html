<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Somers CT</h3>
<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>

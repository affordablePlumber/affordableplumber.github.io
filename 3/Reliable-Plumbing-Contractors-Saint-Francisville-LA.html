<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

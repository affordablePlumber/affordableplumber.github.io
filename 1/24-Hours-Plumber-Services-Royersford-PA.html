<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

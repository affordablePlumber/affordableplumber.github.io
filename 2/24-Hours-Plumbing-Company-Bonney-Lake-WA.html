<p>No other room in a house includes as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, in addition to flexible rubber traps. Debris can quickly capture in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not provide necessary support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable service, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and household.</p>

<p>Backflow preventers are also needed by the plumbing code. Except within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities consumers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Coastline is the plumbing authority within Shoreline's city limitations. Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline when it pertains to backflow preventer requirements.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Many backflow preventers are created to enable the components to be removed for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system. Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not required in many cases. Some elements such as relief valve bodies might need to be gotten rid of from the main body to assist in a repair. Understanding the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>

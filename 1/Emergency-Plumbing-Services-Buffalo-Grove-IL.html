<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive choice.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

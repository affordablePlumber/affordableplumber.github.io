<p>Sewer lines have one important role: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent.

This activates the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

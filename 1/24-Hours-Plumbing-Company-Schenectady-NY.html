<p>DCVs are specifically developed to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for typical fire security applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 independently operating spring-loaded check valves (normally inside a single valve body), 4 test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve.

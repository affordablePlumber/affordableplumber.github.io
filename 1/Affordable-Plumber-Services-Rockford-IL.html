<p>When compared to gas models, electrical designs are simpler and cheaper to install as electrical power is already offered through the main power supply line. For gas hot water heater, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a practical source of gas developed. Another function of an electric water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly using vents and ducts in order to operate correctly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or long-term connection between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>

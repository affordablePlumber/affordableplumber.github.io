For the valve to work appropriately, the discharge pipe must be kept devoid of obstructions (Fig. A).</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does take place regularly than you believe! Frequently it occurs at night when you don't observe the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

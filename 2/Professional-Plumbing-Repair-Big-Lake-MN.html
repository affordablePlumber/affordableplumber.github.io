<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Upon making a high school diploma or GED, prospective plumbing contractors need to start a plumbing apprenticeship. Apprentice programs are the most common method for plumbers to discover the abilities needed to become effective in the trade. Most apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor organizations. Programs generally last 4 to five years and need apprentices to complete a specific variety of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>

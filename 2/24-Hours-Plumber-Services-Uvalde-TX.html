<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it might wreak undesirable issues on your home. A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) ranges from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Prior to selection and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies need to be protected from freezing temperatures and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly need to be utilized. Consult manufacturers specifications for recommendations. When looking for plumbing services in the area, specify with your requirements and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the innovative experience and licenses related to a plumbing contractor.</p>

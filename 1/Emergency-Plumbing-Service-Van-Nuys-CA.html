<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element.

<h3>Necessary Services That A Good Plumbing Service Can Provide South San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The highly harmful insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company employee had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external house hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through your house into the water supply.</p>

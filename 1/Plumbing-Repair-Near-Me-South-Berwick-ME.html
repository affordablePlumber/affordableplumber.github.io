<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater in South Berwick Maine</h2>
<p>Hard water use may affect the efficiency of household devices. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with large build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits likewise collect to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence impacting their efficiency.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4.

Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on damp or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>

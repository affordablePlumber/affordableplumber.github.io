<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

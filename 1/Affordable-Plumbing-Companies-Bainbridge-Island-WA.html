When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and major leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leaks, we discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-term solution.</p>

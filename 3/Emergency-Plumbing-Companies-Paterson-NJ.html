<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to damage micro-organisms and provide purified water.

Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>Commercial buildings with pitch roofs may likewise require roofing system drain cleaning. Their roofing system gutters are normally linked to 4-inch diameter vertical roof drain pipes, which in turn, connect to 4-inch diameter underground horizontal pipes that flow into community storm drains just below street level. Roto-Rooter has the experience and mechanical ability to completely clean such commercial roofing drains to restore complete drainage to the system.</p>

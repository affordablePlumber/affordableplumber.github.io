<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If whatever is prepared, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and therefore the total costs. Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>

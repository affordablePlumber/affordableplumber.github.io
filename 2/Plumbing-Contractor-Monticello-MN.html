<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>

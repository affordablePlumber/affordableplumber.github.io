<p>From underneath the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

<p>As soon as you've found the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are ready to connect your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

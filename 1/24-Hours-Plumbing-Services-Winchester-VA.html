When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply.

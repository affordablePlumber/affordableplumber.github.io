<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Moscow PA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can also be hard to repair as they are generally located behind the sink, in cramped spaces. The best way to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches use up too much area and need a wide swing angle, which may be challenging to acquire in little areas.</p>

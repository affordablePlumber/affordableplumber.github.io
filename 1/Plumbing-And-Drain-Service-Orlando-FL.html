Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

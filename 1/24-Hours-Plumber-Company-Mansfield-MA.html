<p>The easiest way to keep you and your family safe from the possible hazards of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water functions are considered a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area must be indicated on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond need to be evaluated upon installation and after that annually.</p>

<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber West Hempstead NY</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with most homeowners investing around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>

<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in West Hempstead NY 11552?</h3>

More and more people are selling their old water heaters for brand-new, tankless variations. Whether you're seeking to increase your home's eco-friendliness or just plain tired of running out of hot water, a tankless water heater could be the ideal solution for you.</p>
<p>A Pilot Light That Has Headed out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you use a gas water heater rather than a system with an electrical heating aspect, there is a great chance your pilot light has headed out. This could be because of an issue with your thermocouple, a lack of combustible air, or simply a strong breeze. Regardless of what the concern is, however, your water heater will not have the ability to function till the pilot light is re-lit.</p>

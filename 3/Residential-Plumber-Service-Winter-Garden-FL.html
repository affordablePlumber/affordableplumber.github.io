<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

If your existing disposal clogs typically, is loud, leaks or does not operate correctly, it may be time for a replacement. Installations need to only be carried out by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>

A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and merely needs to be replaced.</p>

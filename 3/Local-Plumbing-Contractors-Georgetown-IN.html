<p>Ensuring plumbing devices such as lawn sprinkler and fire pumps are isolated to their own particular networks is imperative in order to protect drinkable water security. Having a plumbing inspection is quite standard when purchasing a house or flat. If it's a leasing I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be among the most costly repair projects if neglected.

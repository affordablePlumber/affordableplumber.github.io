<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our presentation. The actions for changing a gas water heater are exactly the exact same, and those for an electrical water heater are similar. Repeating leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we suggest replacing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>

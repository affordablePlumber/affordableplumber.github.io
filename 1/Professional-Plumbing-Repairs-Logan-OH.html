<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

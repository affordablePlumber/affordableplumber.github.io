Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

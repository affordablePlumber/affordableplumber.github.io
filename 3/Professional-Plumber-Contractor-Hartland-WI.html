<p>A lot of demand for plumbers will come from brand-new building and construction and the need to repair and maintain plumbing systems in existing residences and other buildings. Work of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace changes to building codes that require the use of fire suppression systems. It's likely that the new system will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink currently. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in location-- start by removing the old drain. Many drains are attached to the sink by a big nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>

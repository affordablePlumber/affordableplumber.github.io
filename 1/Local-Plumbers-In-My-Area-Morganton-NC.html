Frequent blockages, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, might show an issue with the disposal. It is most likely due to too much usage over a long period of time if there are leakages coming from your system. A lot of these leaks can be fixed, but if they end up being larger and more regular, you must think about total system replacement.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

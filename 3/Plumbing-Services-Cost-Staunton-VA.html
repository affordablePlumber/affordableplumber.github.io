Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

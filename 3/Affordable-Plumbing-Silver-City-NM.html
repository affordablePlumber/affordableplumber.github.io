When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water in reverse into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow backwards into the drinkable water supply. To protect water quality, backflow protection is required where completion user positions a threat of contaminating the city's water system.</p>

<p>Great deals of bad things are being said on this article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are saying. Since they do not like the technology and not because it doesn't work, will also state something doesn't work well just. If this heater is installed in a home with numerous bathrooms, the piping process adds to the installation expenses.</p>

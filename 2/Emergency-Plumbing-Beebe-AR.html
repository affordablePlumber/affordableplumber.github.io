<p>Most homeowners have conventional hot water heater that include a tank where warm water is saved. While these are affordable at first buy, they are not the most effective or reliable method for you to get warm water, particularly if your system is obsoleted. It might be time to consider replacing it with a brand-new energy-efficient design if your water heater is more than 8 years old. That's where the plumbers at Casteel comes in.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are considered a health risk if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be indicated on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond need to be checked upon installation and then yearly.</p>

<p>You can also depend upon water softeners to lower your everyday operating costs by saving detergent and enabling you to use lower water temperatures while maintaining a premium wash. Water hardness, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, varies across the U.S. from somewhat hard (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>Are your plumbing pipes beginning to show indications of wear? We can repipe your entire pipe system, or repair particular sections in your home or office the exact same day. Just like working with a plumber for simple repairs, you or your contractor need to request for proof of a license and license number. Likewise verify that workers' settlement and liability insurance policies are active.</p>
<p>Brand brand-new garbage disposals work faster and more efficiently than older models, conserving you time and utility costs in the long run. Nevertheless, it is necessary to correctly maintain your disposal. Be sure to run it every day to keep it clear of debris. Always run water before and after grinding. Do not push too much waste down the disposal at one time.</p>

<p>Camera are among the most important tools in the plumbing company. Determine the size of the pipes in the house and around the home - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to offer adequate circulation.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up.

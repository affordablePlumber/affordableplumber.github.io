Backflow prevention devices run by enabling water to flow in only one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, drinkable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water supply.

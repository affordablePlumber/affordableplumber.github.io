<p>No other room in a house consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, along with flexible rubber traps. Particles can quickly catch in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not offer necessary support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a great option s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>

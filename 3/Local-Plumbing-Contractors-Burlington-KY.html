<p>Once you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>

<p>The Required Inspections Table revealed below lists those inspections that need to be carried out to verify that your work abides by the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Regulations. Please note that Virginia's Building Code restricts the use of any plumbing fixtures or devices prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is beneficial to you throughout the course of your job. Please call our Structure Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any concerns about what is needed for each inspection or if you need assistance scheduling an inspection. Structure, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Protection work need extra authorizations and inspections. Different notices are available to discuss the inspections needed for each type of authorization.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>

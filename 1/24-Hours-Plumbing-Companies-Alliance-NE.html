<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon flow, taste, color or smell.

More complex problems with water temperature or pressure may require replacing the hot water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does happen more frequently than you think! When you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building tasks quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

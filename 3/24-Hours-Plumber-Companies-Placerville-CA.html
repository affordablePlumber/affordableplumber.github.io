<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Placerville CA</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. There is potential for the infected water to become a health threat if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>

<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Cottondale AL</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

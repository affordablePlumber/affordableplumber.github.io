<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener.

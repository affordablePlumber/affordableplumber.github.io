<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll need to replace it. Although any broken appliance is irritating to handle, the bright side is that setting up a replacement disposal will be cheaper than installing a new waste disposal unit in a sink that has never ever had one in the past. Depending upon the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the cost.</p>
<p>However is a plumbing catastrophe imminent or just a concern for the distant future? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house costs $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floorings, so you definitely don't wish to get the job done before it's needed.

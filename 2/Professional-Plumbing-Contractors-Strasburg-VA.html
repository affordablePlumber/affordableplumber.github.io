<h3>Fix Toilet in Strasburg Virginia</h2>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

Watering backflow prevention assemblies must be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure appropriate backflow prevention remains in place to safeguard our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send out a testing suggestion notification 1 month before the annual test is due.</p>
<p>Drains, drains and waste piping are checked for correct grading to keep downward flow. The plumbing system is checked for leakages. We inspect that the material utilized in the plumbing system is approved by a recognized testing lab.

<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

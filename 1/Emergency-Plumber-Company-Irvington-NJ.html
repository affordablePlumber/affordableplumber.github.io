This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

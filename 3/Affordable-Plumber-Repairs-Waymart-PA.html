<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, frequently referred to as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the different jurisdictions within the State; reduce the structure's energy and water use; decrease waste; and minimize the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can sometimes get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>

<p>Water firmness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>
<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a terrible impact on your organisation. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more wear and tear than residential drains and are more susceptible to blockages and blockage.

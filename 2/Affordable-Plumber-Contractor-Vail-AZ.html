<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water.

Adequate drainage should also be offered.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to ensure it works. Check beneath to be sure there aren't any leakages.

No, it is not a regular event, however it does occur more often than you believe! When you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes, typically it happens at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow.

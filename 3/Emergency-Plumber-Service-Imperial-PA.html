<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

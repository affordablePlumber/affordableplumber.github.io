Repairs are the proper fix for issues such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, however if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a bigger issue to take a look at.

<p>Every reasonable buyer checks a minimum of numerous things before making a down payment on a house. As you may be aware that the water quality here is quite bad. However are you conscious just how bad? Most of the Valley in reality has a few of the worst water in the nation. We rank 3rd for the outright worst water in the country according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do live in a desert after all. In reality the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even drink has a chlorine level that is perfect for pool. We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond national health standards, and a even high percentage of contaminants in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our typical water hardness level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity reasons "really tough water".</p>
<p>Sewage systems, drains and waste piping are looked for proper grading to keep down flow. The plumbing system is evaluated for leakages. We inspect that the material used in the plumbing system is approved by a recognized testing laboratory. We prohibit cross connections in between safe water and water from a questionable source and restrict the discharge of hazardous waste to the sewer system. We also check the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>

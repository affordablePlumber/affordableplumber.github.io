<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Calistoga CA 94515</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>

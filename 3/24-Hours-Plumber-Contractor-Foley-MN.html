<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based on polymer type ingredients such as sodium polycarboxylate.

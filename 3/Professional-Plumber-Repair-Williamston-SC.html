Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals.

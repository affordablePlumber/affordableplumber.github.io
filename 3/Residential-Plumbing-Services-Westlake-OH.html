However, the majority of toilet repairs are simple and easy jobs - such as changing a used flapper - that most people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<h3>Septic Tank Repair in Westlake Ohio</h2>
<p>If you're coping with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless appliance repair costs, you need a water softener.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

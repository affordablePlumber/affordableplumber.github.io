Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

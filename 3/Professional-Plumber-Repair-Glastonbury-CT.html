<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by safeguarding your water-using equipment from bad performance and early failure. Some difficult water problems are very visible, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged.

Invisible or noticeable, these problems have actually real costs related to them. Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or reconditioning costs and can irritate your customers. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy bills, and too soon harmed RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses.

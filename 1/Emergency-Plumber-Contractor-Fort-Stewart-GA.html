<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

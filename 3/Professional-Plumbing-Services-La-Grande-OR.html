<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause hard water stay with the beads, and the treated water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>

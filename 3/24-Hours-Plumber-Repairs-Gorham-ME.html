<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>

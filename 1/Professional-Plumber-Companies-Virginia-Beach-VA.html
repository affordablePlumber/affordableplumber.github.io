<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Virginia Beach VA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

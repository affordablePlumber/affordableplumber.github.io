<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather security.

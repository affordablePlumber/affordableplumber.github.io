<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Irvine KY 40336</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based upon polymer type ingredients such as sodium polycarboxylate. Faulty Parts: If your toilet won't stop running, it's most likely due to problems with a toilet tank element. In such cases, we are typically able to replace that single element.

When you experience obstructions in multiple drains at once in your home, then that typically implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in numerous locations and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>

In addition, the longer you postpone to require professional assistance, the greater the likelihood that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>

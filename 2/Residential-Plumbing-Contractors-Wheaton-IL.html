<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you've found the journey lever you desire remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>

Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load.

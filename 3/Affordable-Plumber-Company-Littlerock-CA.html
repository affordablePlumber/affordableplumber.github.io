<h3>Main Sewer Line Repair in Littlerock California</h2>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

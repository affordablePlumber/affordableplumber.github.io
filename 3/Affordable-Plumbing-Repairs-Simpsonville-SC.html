Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement. While some of these issues can be attributed to typical wear and tear or improper installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit becomes damaged by products that should not be run through it.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, collected food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the centerpiece in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems.

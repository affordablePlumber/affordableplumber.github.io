Without practical draining, extreme pressure can trigger your piping system to break and leak leading to costly water damage.</p>
<p>You depend on your drains to carry wastewater from your sink, shower or tub. In time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.

However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned.

That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

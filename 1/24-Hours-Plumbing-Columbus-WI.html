<p>The typical option is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually suffers from rust and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

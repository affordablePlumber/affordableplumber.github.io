<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>

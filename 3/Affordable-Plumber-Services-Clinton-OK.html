<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

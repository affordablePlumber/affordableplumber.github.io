<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Washington PA 15301</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>

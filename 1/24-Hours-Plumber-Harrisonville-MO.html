<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Houses that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not want to reside in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat wall mount by correcting it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some clogs. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>

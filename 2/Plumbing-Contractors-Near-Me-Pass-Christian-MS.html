<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Pass Christian MS</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

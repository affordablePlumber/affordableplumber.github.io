<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is deterioration in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater. This is especially true if you have untreated difficult water, which contains harsh minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is difficult to repair. Leakages often indicate a new unit replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

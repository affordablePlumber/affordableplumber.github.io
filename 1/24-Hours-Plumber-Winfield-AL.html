So-called tough" water is the outcome of ground water passing through and liquifying rocks and minerals, which then release calcium and magnesium ions. These liquified ions give hard water its characteristics.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are safe, however with time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year.

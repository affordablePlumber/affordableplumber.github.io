<h3>Clogged Sink in Potsdam New York</h2>
<p>Is your drain clogged with toilet, particles, or hair paper? After years of use, drains can gather destructive accumulation.

We can accomplish this through a variety of approaches such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed.

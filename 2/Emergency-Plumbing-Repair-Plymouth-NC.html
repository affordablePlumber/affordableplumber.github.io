This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>

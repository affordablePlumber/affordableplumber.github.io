<h3>Floor Drain Cleaning in Hamburg New York</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have achieved a development in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates short-term firmness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major constraints of existing softening innovations.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of piping that are utilized in the repiping procedure. Since of their efficiency, safety and cost, copper piping and PEX piping are utilized. Copper piping prevents germs from growing inside of the pipe providing healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic product that is both lightweight and versatile. This material is resistant versus corrosion and will help enhance water pressure.</p>

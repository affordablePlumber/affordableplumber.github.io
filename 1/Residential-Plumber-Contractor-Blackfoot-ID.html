<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As difficult water passes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause hard water adhere to the beads, and the cured water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.

Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

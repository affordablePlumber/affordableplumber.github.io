<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water.

Sufficient drainage must also be supplied.</p>

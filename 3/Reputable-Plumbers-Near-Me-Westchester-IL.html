<p>Other signs you might need to repipe consist of rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling.

<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water firmness can be gotten rid of fairly easily by using an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations refer to favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the firmness ions with a nonhardness ion. Master plumbers will not charge for their services grossly extreme rates, or otherwise take undue benefit of an unwary public.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or irreversible connection between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to protect them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only eliminate as much building material as necessary to reach, separate, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. If you want, you can set up to have actually additional pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel.</p>

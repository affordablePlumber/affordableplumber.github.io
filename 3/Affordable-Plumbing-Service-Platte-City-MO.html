<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience blockages in numerous drains at the same time in your house, then that normally suggests that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in numerous places and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>

A lot of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Usually, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating system, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>

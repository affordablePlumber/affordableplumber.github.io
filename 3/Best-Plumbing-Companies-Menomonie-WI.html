<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Menomonie WI</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>

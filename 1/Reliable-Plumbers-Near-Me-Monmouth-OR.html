We now have cleaned and inspected the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now prepared to begin the re-assembly process. Some designs need the elements to be eliminated in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Many parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each part is returned into the body, it is important to put them back in the appropriate location. It is also important that as they are positioned back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the parts or mistakenly put in the body. The parts must be positioned so that the guides have the ability to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

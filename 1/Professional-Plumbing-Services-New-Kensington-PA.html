<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair expense may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater.</p>

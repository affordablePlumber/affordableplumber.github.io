<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

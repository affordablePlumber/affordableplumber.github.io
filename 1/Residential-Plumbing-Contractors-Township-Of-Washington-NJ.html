<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Township Of Washington NJ 07676?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

You might end up doing more damage than good if you continue to battle with it, which can create long-term problems.

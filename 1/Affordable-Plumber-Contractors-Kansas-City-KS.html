<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by protecting your water-using equipment from bad efficiency and premature failure. Some hard water problems are very visible, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undiscovered, like scale on water heater elements and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Unnoticeable or visible, these problems have actually real costs related to them. Clogged components cause replacement or refurbishing expenses and can irritate your customers. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and prematurely harmed RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement costs.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>

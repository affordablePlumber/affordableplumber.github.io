<p>Once you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

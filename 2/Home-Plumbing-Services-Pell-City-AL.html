Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be offered.</p>

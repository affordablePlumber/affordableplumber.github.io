<p>High water pressure also leads to thermal expansion in water heaters which can lead to possible water damage if the hot water heater leaks or burst.

Changing the pipes for lots of plumbing components needs more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>

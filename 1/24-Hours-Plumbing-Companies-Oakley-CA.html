<p>Sinkholes do not only take place in your backyard, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to find out rapidly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running beneath your home's foundation. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out underneath your home, a sinkhole will cause the foundation to shift and establish cracks. In this case, you'll need professional plumbers as well as foundation repair specialists.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based on polymer type active ingredients such as salt polycarboxylate.

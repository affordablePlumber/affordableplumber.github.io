<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps record wetness and sediment so that they don't enter the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap might be consisted of in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention devices to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that could enable tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These devices go through testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In most cases, they undergo routine tests later, as well.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>

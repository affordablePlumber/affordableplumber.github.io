<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in numerous parts of the plumbing system, most typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow problems and even stop a component from flowing altogether. The next typical problem that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Deterioration: The most typical problem is deterioration in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is particularly real if you have neglected hard water, which includes severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product in time.

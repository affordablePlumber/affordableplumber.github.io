<p>Metal alloys are susceptible to an electro-chemical condition called corrosion. Corrosion can actually eat a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or change the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The result of deterioration on a metal alloy need to be assessed to identify if the part is usable or must be changed.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>

<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Sidney MT</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a major factor in affected sewer lines. Tree roots grow in several directions and can get very large causing intrusion of the lines underground. Another truth is that tree roots look for water sources and will follow the source leading them directly to sewer lines eventually growing right into them and triggering significant sewer line problems.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Typically, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>

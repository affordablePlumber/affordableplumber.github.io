<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and solidify or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

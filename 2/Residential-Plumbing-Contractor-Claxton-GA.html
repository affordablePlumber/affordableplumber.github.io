<p>Another irritating problem is when the flush valve in the tank stops working or uses out. , if you hear the toilet running continuously or occasionally you most likely need the valve or float changed.. Failing to repair a running toilet can lead to wasted water and a really high water costs. Water in Florida is costly so don't postpone-- get a running toilet fixed.</p>

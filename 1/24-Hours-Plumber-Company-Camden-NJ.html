<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

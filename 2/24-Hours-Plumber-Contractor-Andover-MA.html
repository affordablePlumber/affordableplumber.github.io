<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Andover MA</h3>
<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the outer covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Also referred to as cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we turn on our end to unclog drains. This technique works best for clearing out drains clogged with hair and debris, such as showers and sinks. Backflow is the circulation of water in the wrong direction from a client's water system into the general public water system. Backflow might be triggered by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>

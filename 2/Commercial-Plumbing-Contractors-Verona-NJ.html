<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in Verona NJ 07044</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

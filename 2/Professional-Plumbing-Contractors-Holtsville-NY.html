<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly option.</p>

This can increase the quantity of time needed to install the new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This really depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how tough the old system is to eliminate. In most cases, removal will only include an additional $25 to $50 to the total costs, but in many cases the expenses could be greater if additional pipes should also be changed.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Polson MT</h3>
<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Throughout regrowth, the water softener will take the salt water service into the softener tank and the ion exchange process happens again, just this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.

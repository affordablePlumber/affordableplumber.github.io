<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>

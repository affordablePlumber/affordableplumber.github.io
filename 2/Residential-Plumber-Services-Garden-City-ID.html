For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from automobile washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement may stream backwards into the safe and clean water system.

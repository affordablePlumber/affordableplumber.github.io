<p>In the 1990 â€² s, dry spell conditions motivated water companies to execute water conservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

Continuous blockages indicate your toilet no longer has actually the power required to effectively eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent man. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.

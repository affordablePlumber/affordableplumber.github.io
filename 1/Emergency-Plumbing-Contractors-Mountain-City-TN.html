<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can cause a bad odor and taste. When you include a water softener, it gets rid of the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes good.</p>

While NFPA acknowledges that backflow remains a genuine health concern, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are properly evaluated by qualified workers.</p>

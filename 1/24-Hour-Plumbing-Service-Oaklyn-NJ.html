Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually struggles with deterioration and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

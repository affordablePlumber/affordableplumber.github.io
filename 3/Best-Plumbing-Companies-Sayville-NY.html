<p>Metal alloys are susceptible to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Rust can actually consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or change the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer.

<p>The usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately struggles with rust and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

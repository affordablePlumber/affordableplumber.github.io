<p>The Required Inspections Table revealed below lists those inspections that must be performed to confirm that your work adheres to the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code.

We hope this list is useful to you throughout the course of your job.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>

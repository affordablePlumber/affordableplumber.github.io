<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

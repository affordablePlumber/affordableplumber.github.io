<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite direction from its normal flow. IRWD's safe and clean water system is developed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "normal," the direction of water flow can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the potential for infected water getting in the potable water circulation system.</p>
<p>Repiping is just installing all brand-new incoming water lines to replace an old failing system. Most people repipe because they have repeated leakages in their galvanized pipes, slab leakages from copper pipes in the concrete floor or leakages that have actually caused damage to their home. Many have a neighbor who has had comprehensive water damage due to a leak and wish to avoid a similar event in their home. Some individuals get tired of the rust in their water or low pressure.

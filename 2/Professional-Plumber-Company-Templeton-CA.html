If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you may have a concept of where your lateral is located. If you do not know, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even go into and break the line. If you are working with someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will likewise know the locations to prevent. Your line will be simple to recognize if you have a clean-out.</p>
<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve.

In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>

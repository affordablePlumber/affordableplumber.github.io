<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals found in water. Generally, minerals get there since groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues travel with the water up until it is in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to remove liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers difficult water.</p>
<p>This short article aims to deal with the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a couple of confusing realities that typically lead people to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work. Your home's main gutter system collects rainwater from the roofing system line and controls its course down the house to ground; but the water might still puddle beside the foundation. That's where underground rain gutter drains are practical. They connect to the downspouts on your home and move water far from the structure underground. Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a process used to clear debris from the side gutter pipes on your home.</p>
<p>List prices for home water softeners may range from approximately $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and type of softener. Softeners are ranked by the total number of grains the unit can get rid of prior to being charged. The cost of salt is around $5 to $8 per 40-pound bag of salt chloride (NaCl), depending on the kind purchased, and up to $25 per 40-pound bag for potassium chloride (KCl).</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to ensure it works. Examine underneath to be sure there aren't any leakages.

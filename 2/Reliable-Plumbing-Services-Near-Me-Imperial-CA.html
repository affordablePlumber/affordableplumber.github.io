<p>Maintenance or replacement, you can anticipate professional service from experienced plumbing professionals when you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair. Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to stream in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can flow both in and out of a structure or fixture.

For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might flow in reverse into the potable water supply. To protect water quality, backflow protection is required where the end user poses a risk of polluting the city's water supply.</p>

<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Cos Cob CT 06807</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
<p>We are offered day and night to resolve your drain issues. Contact us now at (330) 400-3334 for emergency drain cleaning services from our plumbers. Improper maintenance such as failure to replace filters or media at the proper time will be evaluated as "overlook".

<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>

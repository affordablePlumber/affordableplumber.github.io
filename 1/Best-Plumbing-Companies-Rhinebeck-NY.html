Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.

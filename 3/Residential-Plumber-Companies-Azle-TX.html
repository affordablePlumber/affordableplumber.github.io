<p>Our licensed plumbing technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a quick fix in the short term, it can cause even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are installed in areas where water might trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic devices.

Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Muncie IN</h3>
<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, especially if that water is hot, the within your system is most likely rusty.

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh.

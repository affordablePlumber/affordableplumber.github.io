<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

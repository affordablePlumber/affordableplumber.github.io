A backflow preventer is a device created to keep water inside fire-protection and other water-based systems on a residential or commercial property-- guaranteeing it only travels in one direction: from the water pipe into the system's pipes.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>

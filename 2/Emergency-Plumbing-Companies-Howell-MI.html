Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

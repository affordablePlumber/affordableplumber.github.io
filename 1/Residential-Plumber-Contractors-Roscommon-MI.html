<p>The heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this particular issue is when you have no hot water flowing in your home. The reasons for this can vary from leakages, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the components may be sufficient if it is one of the discussed issues. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening frequently, then a hot water heater replacement is required.</p>

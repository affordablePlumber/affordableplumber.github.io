<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>

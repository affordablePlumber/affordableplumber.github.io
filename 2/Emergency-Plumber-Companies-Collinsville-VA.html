<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

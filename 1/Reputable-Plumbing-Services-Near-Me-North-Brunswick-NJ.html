<p>Next, examine the body. Depending on the size and producer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again important for the repair specialist to be knowledgeable about the hardness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not damaging. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to decrease any scale development or corrosion. It is essential that the repair specialist is sensitive to the solidity and type of the various coatings used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective finish.</p>

<p>This short article aims to resolve the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: a correctly configured water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive.

<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or temporary connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>

<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>

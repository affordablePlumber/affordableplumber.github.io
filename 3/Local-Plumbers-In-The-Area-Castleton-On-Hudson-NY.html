<h3>How To Pick Good 24 Hour Emergency Plumbers For Pipe Video Inspections Castleton On Hudson NY</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>In the sinks, tubs, and showers in your home, the clogs occur because hair and soap accumulate in the drains. Is your water heater draining properly?

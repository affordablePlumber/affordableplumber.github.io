<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that ought to likewise be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and split or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so used or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever is in tip-top shape.</p>

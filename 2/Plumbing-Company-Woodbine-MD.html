<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

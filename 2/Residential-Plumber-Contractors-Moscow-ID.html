Atmospheric vacuum breaker. Although you may have several atmospheric vacuum breakers on your system, the water will only stream through among them on its method to the sprinklers or emitters. Therefore, you only consist of the pressure loss for one vacuum breaker in your estimation. Most producers do not have pressure loss information for vacuum breakers, so assume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no maker's literature is readily available.</p>
<p>Before choice and installation, describe makers literature for temperature level ranges. All assemblies must be secured from freezing temperature levels and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly need to be used.

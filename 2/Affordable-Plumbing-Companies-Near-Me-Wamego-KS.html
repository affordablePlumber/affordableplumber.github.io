<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>

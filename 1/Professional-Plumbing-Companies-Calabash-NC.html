For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide sufficient flow.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to analyze. You may need to change toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is reasonably brand-new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can search for your state's licensing details. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>

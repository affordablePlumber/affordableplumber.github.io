<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service West Salem OH</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

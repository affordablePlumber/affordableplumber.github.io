<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler normally are installed in locations where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and merely needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>

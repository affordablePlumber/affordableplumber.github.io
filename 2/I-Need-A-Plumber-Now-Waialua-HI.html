<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

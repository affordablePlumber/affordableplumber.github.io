<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if essential. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Blocked Trap: The toilet trap is located behind the bowl and shaped like the letter S. In some cases, toys, toilet paper, paper towels and other particles get stuck in the trap and cause a clog.

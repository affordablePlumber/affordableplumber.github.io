<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from reversing in the opposite direction. You may be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, with time, it still does wear away. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>

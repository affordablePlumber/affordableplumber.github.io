Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and changed with new rubber parts. It is necessary that just initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Testing need to be finished by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor must possess a legitimate, up-to-date plumbing license, present insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing certification, and currently calibrated test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is needed.</p>

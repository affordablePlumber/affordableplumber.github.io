Employment of sprinklerfitters is anticipated to increase as states continue to adopt modifications to building codes that need the use of fire suppression systems. It's most likely that the new system will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal attached to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by removing the old drain.

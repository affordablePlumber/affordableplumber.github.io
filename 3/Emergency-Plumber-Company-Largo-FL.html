<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. The majority of kitchen sink clogs are due to heavy grease accumulation and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the garbage and utilize the disposal for the small particles that are left.

When turned on the motor impellers and spins-- likewise called lugs-- throw littles food against a mill ring.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>

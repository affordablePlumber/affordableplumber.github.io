<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Princeton TX</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

<p>No hot water-- The absence of warm water is the biggest indication that there is something wrong with your San Antonio hot water heater.

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low.

Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

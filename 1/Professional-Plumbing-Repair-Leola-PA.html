<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Leola PA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Water Authority uses rebates for setting up low circulation toilets, urinals, and low circulation showerheads. High performance, low circulation toilets utilize 1.28 gallons per flush and urinals utilize much less water. Older toilets might be flushing approximately 5 gallons per flush! Refunds of approximately $100 are available for low circulation toilets. This might balance out the majority of the cost of the toilet depending on the design you pick.</p>

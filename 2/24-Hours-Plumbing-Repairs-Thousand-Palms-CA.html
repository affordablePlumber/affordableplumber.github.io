But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively imagined.

It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. , if you plan to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>

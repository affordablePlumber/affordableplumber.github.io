<h3>Drain Plumbing in Homosassa Florida</h2>
<p>Lots of property owners will see a clog and immediately grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this type of chemical may get the job done, it's actually quite destructive to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners frequently use lye as the active component. Lye is designed to eat through obstructions and liquify them, however it also penetrates your pipes and produces weak spots that are vulnerable to burst.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>

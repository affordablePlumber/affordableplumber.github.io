The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

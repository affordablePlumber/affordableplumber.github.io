<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream could trigger a reversal in flow.</p>

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

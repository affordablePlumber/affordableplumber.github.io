<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in numerous parts of the plumbing system, many commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow problems or perhaps stop a fixture from streaming altogether. The next common concern that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so extreme that it minimizes the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>

Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.

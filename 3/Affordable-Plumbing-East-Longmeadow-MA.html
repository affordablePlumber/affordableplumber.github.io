<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>

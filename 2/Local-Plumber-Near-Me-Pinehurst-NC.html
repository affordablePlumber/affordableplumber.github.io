However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off.

One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Los Gatos CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>

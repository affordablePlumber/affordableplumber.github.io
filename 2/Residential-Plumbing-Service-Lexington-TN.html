<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to solidify and crack or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

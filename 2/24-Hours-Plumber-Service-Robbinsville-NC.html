<p>Many need for plumbers will come from new construction and the need to repair and preserve plumbing systems in existing homes and other structures. Work of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace changes to building codes that need the use of fire suppression systems. It's likely that the new unit will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in location-- start by eliminating the old drain. The majority of drains are attached to the sink by a large nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>

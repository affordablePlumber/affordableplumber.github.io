<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and depends on a good balance of water pressure in order to work effectively. If your showers become frustrating, or it appears little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the house and the variety of restrooms and plumbing fixtures-- utility room, damp bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your last costs.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>

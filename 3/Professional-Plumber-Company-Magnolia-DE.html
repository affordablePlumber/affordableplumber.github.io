<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Magnolia DE 19962?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

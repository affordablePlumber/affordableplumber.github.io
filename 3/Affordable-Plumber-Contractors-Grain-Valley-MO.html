<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some homes were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Generally, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by energies or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to assist prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and split or just be so squished that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak.

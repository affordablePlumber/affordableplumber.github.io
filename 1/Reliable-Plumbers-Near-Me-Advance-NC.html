<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Advance NC</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Another method to deal with a clog is by using a chemical cleaning product or if you fear they may be too severe on your pipes, you can try old home remedies like hot water, vinegar, and baking soda. If you've attempted everything and the clog stays, call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and inquire about our clogged toilet repair service.

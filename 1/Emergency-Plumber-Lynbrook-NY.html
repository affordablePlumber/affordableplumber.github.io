<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Lynbrook NY 11563</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leakages fixed and could not be better with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are really experienced, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>

<p>The EcoWater Compact Series Water Softening System is a compact single tank cabinet" design softener, making it a reliable and convenient  system for your home. Friendly, educated technician. He got our drain cleaned out in a professional and extremely efficient manner. I would not be reluctant to call Roto-Rooter for any future requirements. Toilet Runs Periodically - Don't you hate it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It normally indicates there is a concern with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water somewhere.</p>

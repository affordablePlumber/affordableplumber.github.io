<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back since he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>

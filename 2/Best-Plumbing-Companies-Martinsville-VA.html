When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers not adhering to these guidelines for a given application and which are worn out or broken and require replacement should be changed by a backflow preventer which does comply to the rules for the given application.

It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately.

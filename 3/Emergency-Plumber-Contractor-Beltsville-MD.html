<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have actually accomplished a breakthrough in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) technology. SACr physically removes temporary solidity without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are major restrictions of present softening innovations.</p>

The policies also need a state certified backflow service technician test the backflow preventer yearly.</p>

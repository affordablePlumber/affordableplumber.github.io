<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can produce noise. If your energy expenses are increasing, a brand-new, greater efficiency hot water heater can bring them pull back. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, enabling tough water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, relocated to its new area and positioned there.</p>

<p>Distribution pipes transition to even smaller individual service pipes, carrying water to private houses, apartment or condo shops, structures and companies. Depending upon need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water goes into the consumer center through a water meter that tapes circulation rates and water usage for billing functions.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Turn on the water (carefully, so you don't get a cold shower!) and let it flush out the toilet valve for a few seconds.

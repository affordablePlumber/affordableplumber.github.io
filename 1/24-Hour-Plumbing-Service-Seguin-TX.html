<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you have actually found the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way.

<p>When you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've protected the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>

Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>

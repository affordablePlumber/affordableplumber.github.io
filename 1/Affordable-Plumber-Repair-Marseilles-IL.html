<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that water contamination might pose a severe public health danger, local laws need annual inspections to guarantee your backflow prevention devices are working as they must be. Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear out over time and it's important that they receivethe exact same regular maintenance that your vehicle or A/C system gets to guarantee your family's water is clean & safe.</p>

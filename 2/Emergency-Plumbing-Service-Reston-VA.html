<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

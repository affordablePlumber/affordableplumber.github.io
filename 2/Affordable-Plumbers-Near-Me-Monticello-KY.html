<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to many different types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to deteriorate from rust and might put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your home. This might not require totally repiping the house, given that newer materials may have already been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you pinpoint precisely what work needs to be done.</p>

If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. Many drains are attached to the sink by a large nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>

Recurring repairs and leaks. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run.

You may end up doing more damage than good if you continue to combat with it, which can create irreversible problems.

Repairs are proper for small leaks, particularly if you have plumbing that was set up in simply the past ten years.

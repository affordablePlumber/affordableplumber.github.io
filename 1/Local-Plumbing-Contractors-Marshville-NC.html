<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner set. The total repair bill might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).

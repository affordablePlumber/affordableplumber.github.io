<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in areas where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts.

<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide.

If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities.

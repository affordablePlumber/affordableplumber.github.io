When individuals think of cleaning their drains, their minds normally leap to the conclusion that the drain is clogged.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical service, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>

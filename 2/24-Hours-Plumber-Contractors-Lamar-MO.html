Water pressure might be or stop working minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Yreka CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

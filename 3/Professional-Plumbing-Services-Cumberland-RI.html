There are numerous reasons you may need to repipe your house or service. Deterioration of pipes might trigger low water pressure, rusty colored water, lowered water circulation, or leakages. If you are going to redesign it is a good time to repipe prior to you paint or finish your walls.  It is essential to understand the scope of the project before work is begun.

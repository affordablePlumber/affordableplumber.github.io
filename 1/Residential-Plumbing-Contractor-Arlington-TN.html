<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system.

Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical.

Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

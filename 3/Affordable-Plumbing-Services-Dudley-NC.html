<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

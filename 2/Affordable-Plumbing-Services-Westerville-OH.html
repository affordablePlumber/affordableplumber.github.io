<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>

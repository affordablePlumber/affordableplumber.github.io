<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Greenville TX</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

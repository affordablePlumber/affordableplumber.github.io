<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and break or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever remains in great shape.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

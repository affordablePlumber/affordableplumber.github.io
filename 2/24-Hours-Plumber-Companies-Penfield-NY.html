<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as detailed listed below. Both will create a good seal (though the gasket might result in small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Water discoloration: Another obvious indication of your pipes decaying is yellow or brown water coming out of your sinks or tub.

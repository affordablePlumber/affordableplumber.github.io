The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health hazard conditions. They must be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only safeguard versus back siphonage.</p>

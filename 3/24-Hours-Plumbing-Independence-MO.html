<p>A recently set up water heater should not produce weird sounds, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat the water. Things get worse considerably for homes with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>

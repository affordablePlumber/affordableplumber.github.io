<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to various kinds of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from corrosion and might put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home.

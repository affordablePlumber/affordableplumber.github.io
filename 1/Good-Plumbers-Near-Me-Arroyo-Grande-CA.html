<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is designed to bring in corrosion-causing elements in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from rusting. The best method to avoid drain clogs is to watch what you flush. If you take a look at your house's plumbing pipes and see discolorations, staining, flaking, little imprints or rust, your pipes are rusting.

You might need this information later on if you need repairs or there are problems after the preliminary installation. It's easy to forget your water heater till there's an issue since these gadgets are normally out of sight and out of mind. However, if you notice any of these problems, you need to provide your local, trusted plumber a call.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill may be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>

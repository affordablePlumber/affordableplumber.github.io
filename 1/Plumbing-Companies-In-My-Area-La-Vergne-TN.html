<p>When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>When you think of a hot water heater, this is the item that you probably first visualize. An upright cylindrical tank that heats a set quantity of water, with either gas or electrical energy, and is readily available when your faucets and shower need it. It's a really quick, effective technique that has been the standard for many years.

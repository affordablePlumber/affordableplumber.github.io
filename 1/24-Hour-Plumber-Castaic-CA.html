<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Castaic CA 91384</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

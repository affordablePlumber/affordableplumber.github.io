<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day.

This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

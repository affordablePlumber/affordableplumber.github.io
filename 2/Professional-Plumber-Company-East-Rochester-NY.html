<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Examining the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be major problem. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home must have water. This chooses every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a great start if everything is working properly.</p>

At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes could seep into the drinking water, let alone the health threats related to lead.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>A task of setting up that new toilet or elegant faucet should be a task for a licensed plumber with everything at his finger tips to include his knowledge and experience. The repair of a backflow preventer requires the service technician to have the essential knowledge of how to diagnose the problem and restore the backflow prevention assembly to its initial factory requirements. Even if the specialist has the required background, some actions must be taken initially prior to beginning the real repair.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to get in the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>

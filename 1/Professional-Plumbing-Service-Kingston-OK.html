Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

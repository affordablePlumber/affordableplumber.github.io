<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters need to have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Tip: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the within. In many cases, repiping is your only practical choice.</p>

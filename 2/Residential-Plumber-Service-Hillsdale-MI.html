<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does occur more frequently than you think! When you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>

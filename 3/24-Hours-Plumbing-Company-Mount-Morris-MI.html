The hot water heater tank must have some room to account for the expansion that happens when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, thus the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. The force applied by the growth taking location when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and begin leaking if the tank is old and used out. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>

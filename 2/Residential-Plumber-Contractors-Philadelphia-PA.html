<p>As soon as a large enough source of water has been identified and evaluated, the 3rd major part of a water supply system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. The majority of large cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The total repair bill might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>

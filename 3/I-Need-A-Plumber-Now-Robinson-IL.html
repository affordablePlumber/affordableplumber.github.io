We now have actually cleaned and checked the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the elements to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each component is returned into the body, it is important to put them back in the right area. It is also important that as they are positioned back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the parts or mistakenly positioned in the body. The parts need to be placed so that the guides are able to preserve their created tolerances.</p>

This activates the disc to open, permitting air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

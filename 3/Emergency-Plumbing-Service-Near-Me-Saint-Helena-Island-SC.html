<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it typically ends up being corrosive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Saint Helena Island SC</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Repiping a house takes 3 to 5 days with a typical cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on home's size and the company doing the work. Wood advises checking the qualifications of different companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They stay the least expensive and most effective method to rid your water of problematic minerals.</p>

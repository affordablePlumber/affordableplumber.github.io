For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally sodium or often potassium).</p>

Keep in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>

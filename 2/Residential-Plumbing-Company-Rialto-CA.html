<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Rialto CA 92376</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>

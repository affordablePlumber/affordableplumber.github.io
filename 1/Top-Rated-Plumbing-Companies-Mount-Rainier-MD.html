<p>In a busy household, a clogged bathtub drain can become a huge problem overnight. Soap, hair, family pet fur, and even bath toys can add to clogged bathtub drains. With the correct plunger or drain snake, it's possible to unclog a bathtub drain on your own.

<p>Some jurisdictions likewise enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Setting up a hot water heater is not as easy as hooking up a couple of hose pipes. Water heaters need space to operate safely and an incorrectly installed system can be a consistent source of danger in your home.

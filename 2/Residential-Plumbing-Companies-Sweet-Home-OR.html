<p>Leakages are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water.

Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

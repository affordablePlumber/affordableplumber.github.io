Whole-house repiping can certainly be a big endeavor, which is why the service is just performed when definitely necessary.

<p>Most importantly, never plant anything up against your home, in front of windows, nor near to your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your house to the city line.) You may have an idea of where your lateral is situated if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not know, invest the very little cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even go into and break the line. If you are working with somebody to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also understand the locations to prevent.

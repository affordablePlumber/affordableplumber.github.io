<p>It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>
<p>. The size of the population likewise impacts water demand. According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The median per capita water utilize per day is greater in rural counties than metropolitan counties in all the climate areas, except in the Central and Southeast areas"1 with backwoods having less efficient water supply systems2 mostly due to the relative absence of financial resources to update and preserve their systems. So, the greater per capita intake" of water in rural areas may consist of substantial non-revenue water losses from their distribution pipelines. Such problems also factor into the need for backflow preventers at the points of use.</p>

<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While a few of these issues can be attributed to regular wear and tear or incorrect installation, sometimes your garbage disposal becomes harmed by items that should not be gone through it.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to analyze. If your toilet is relatively new, you might need to change bathroom tissue or work with a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing firms to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>

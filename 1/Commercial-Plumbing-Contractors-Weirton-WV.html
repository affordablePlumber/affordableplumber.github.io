For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and break or just be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak.

We inspect that the material utilized in the plumbing system is approved by a recognized testing lab.

<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

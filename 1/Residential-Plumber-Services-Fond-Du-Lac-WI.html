There are only numerous repairs that you can make before you need a new toilet, right? Well, there are a few things to take into consideration if you are weighing your alternatives between toilet repair and toilet replacement. In this week's blog, we will discuss a couple of questions to ask yourself when considering toilet repair or replacement.</p>
<h3>Clear Clogged Toilet in Fond Du Lac Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that rust with time, leading to leaks or other problems. Furthermore, rust or other accumulations in the pipes can limit airflow and make it impossible to use several of your gas-powered devices like the clothing dryer or stove. Based on research conducted by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Advantages Study, 2011.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>

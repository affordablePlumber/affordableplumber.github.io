<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>

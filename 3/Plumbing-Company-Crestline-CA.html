<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off.

One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>

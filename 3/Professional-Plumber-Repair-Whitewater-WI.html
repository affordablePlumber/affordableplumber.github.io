<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by hooking up a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank ought to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may offer a quick fix in the short term, it can trigger far more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

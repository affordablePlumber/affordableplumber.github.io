Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>It's crucial to be conscious that the majority of scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is caused by difficult water if your issue is more associated to scale and mineral accumulation.

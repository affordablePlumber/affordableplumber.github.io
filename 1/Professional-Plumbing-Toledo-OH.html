<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

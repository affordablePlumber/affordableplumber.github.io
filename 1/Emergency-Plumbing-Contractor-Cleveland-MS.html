<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractors in Cleveland</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth understanding about waste disposal unit installation. On average, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not consist of materials or parts. Prices depend upon the precise repair required, where you live, hiring a plumber vs. employing a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

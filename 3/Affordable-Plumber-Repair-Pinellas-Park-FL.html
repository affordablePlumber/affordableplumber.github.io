If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

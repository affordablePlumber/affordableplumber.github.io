<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your backyard.

<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean.

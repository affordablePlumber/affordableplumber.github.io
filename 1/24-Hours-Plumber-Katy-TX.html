<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Katy TX</h3>
<p>A lot of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might require slightly different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, however possibilities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

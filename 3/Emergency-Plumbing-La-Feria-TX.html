<p>Lots of house owners will discover a clog and right away reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

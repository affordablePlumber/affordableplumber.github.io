<p>Two designs of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be used to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>

When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only original factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>

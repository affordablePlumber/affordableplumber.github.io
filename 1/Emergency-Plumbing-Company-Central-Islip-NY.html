<h3>Drain Cleaning Company in Central Islip New York</h2>
<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to remove chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In homes with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic tank and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>

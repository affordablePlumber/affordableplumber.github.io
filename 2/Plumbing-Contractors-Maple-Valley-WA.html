<p>Pests. Sadly, a harmed main sewer line can also lead to unwanted insects inside your house. Rats and bugs can easily squeeze through fractures and gaps in your sewer line and discover their way into your plumbing. These insects can be really hazardous to your health. If you believe you have pests in your plumbing, a plumber can carry out a visual inspection of your sewer line.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>

<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to travel through. Since of the tight space, the pipes often make unusual gurgling sounds as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, resulting in the unusual sounds emanating from your sink.</p>

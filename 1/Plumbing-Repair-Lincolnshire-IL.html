<p>Your home's drains and pipes quietly eliminate countless gallons of wastewater from your home every year without you even giving them a reservation. Nevertheless, when hair, food scraps, feminine health items, toys, and other foreign objects make their way into your drains, they can lead to major problems. While often it's obvious you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is entirely stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for instance), it can sometimes be harder to tell if you have a concern on your hands.</p>

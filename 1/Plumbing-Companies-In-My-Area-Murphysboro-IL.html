<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

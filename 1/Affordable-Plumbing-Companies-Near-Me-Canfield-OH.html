<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated scientific procedure, but simple to treat. It utilizes salt to eliminate minerals and odors discovered in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and attract salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>

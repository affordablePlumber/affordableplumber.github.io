<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each component.

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>

<h3>Water Leak Repair in Grand Junction Colorado</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in locations where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

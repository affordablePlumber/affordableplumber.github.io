<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

<p>Hard water usage might affect the efficiency of household home appliances. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A big scale accumulation slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with big build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashers, thus impacting their performance.</p>
<p>Replacing pipes in between the wall and the sink is more economical than if a plumber needs to cut into a wall to replace broken pipes, which can cost around $400, depending on the size of the job.

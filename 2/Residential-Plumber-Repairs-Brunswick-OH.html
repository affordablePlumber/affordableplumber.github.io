When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

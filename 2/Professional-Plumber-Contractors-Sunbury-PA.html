<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>While waste disposal unit work terrific for breaking down light food residue, they are not designed to manage large amounts of waste.

<p>Find the best water softener for you. One common way for a house's water supply to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Creston IA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be hard to repair as they are generally situated behind the sink, in cramped areas. The best way to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches take up too much space and need a broad swing angle, which might be challenging to obtain in little areas.</p>

This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>

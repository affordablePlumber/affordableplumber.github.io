<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Gainesville FL</h3>
<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

When water flows through a Water Softener, the system filters out these tough water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to stream through plumbing. State certified backflow technicians, offered through your turf watering company or plumber can determine whether your equipment fulfills the requirements. The policies also need a state certified backflow service technician test the backflow preventer every year.</p>

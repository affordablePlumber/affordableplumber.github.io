<p>No other room in a house includes as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Try to find quality materials when replacing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, together with flexible rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a great option s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

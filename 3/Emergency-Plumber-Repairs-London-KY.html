Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>

A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and simply needs to be changed.</p>

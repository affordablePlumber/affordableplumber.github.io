<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water.

There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that could cause false data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly.

The impacts of elevated temperature can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable results from the hydraulic conditions should be acknowledged and their cause fixed. The brand-new parts can soon be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected.</p>

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

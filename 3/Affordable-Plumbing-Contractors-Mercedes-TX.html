Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

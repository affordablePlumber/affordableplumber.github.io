<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores.

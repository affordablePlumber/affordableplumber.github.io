<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers.

<p>The issue of leakage can be credited to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that takes location. The thermal expansion needs to escape, for this reason the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force put in by the expansion occurring when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and begin leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>

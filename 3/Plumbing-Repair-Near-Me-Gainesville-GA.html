<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water supply and private on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections in between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of defense for the general public water supply system.</p>

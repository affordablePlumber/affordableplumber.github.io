Since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>

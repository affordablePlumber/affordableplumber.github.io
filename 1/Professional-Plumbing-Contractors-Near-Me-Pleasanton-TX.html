<p>A Pilot Light That Has Actually Headed out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you utilize a gas hot water heater rather than a system with an electric heating element, there is a great chance your pilot light has gone out. This could be since of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of combustible air, or simply a strong breeze.

<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Just because copper is showing does not suggest you do not have polybutylene pipes. You may have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by energies or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>

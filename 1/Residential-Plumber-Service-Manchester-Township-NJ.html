<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is among the best methods to stay ahead of the game. This extensive inspection can discover serious problems with your sewer line you may not notice till it's too late. Using this technology, you see a walk-through view of the inner-workings of your pipes, and the Seatown Electric Plumbing Heating and Air group can better choose how to rectify your problems. Our Seattle, WA group is relied on for electrical and A/C work, so you know our plumbing services will be reliable also.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-lived connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wire coat hanger by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>

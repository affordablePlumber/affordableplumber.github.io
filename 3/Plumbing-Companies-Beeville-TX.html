<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Beeville TX</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
<p>A Pilot Light That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas water heater instead of a system with an electrical heating component, there is a great chance your pilot burner has headed out. This might be due to the fact that of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of flammable air, or just a strong breeze. Regardless of what the concern is, however, your water heater will not have the ability to work till the pilot light is re-lit.</p>

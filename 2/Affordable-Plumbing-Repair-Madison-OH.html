Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

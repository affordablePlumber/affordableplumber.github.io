<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat wall mount by aligning it. Naturally, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some clogs. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>

<p>If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Houses that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually suffers from deterioration and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

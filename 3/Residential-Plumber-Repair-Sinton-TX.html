If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue.

<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>

Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure correct backflow prevention is in place to safeguard our drinking water throughout the watering season.

<p>Some of the reasons for drain line obstructions in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working garbage disposal, or too much food being disposed down the drain. We will usually suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the seriousness of the scenario. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regrow after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.

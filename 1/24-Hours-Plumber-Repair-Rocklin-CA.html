<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

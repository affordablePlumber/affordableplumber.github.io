<p>A water softener eliminates minerals that create water solidity, among the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Difficult water damages devices, leaves cloudy soap residue across cooking areas and bathrooms, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on hard water for their bathing, cooking, and cleaning, water softeners serve a crucial purpose. A water softener conserves you from changing prematurely ruined water heaters, scaly faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Investing in a water softener conserves you energy, cash, and time, and safeguards your home and your property.</p>

The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>

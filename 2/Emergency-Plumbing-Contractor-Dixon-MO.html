<p>Replacing your flapper might need somewhat different steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter.

<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and fulfill our stiff trust accreditation standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and corroded parts make repairs costly and tough, suggesting a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the appropriate fix for issues such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

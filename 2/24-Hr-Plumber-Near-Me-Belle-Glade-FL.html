<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply.

One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>

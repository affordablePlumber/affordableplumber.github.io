<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Iuka MS</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

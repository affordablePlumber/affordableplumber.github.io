<p>Wanting to repair or replace your garbage disposal? Numerous blockages are brought on by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Know just how much bathroom tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever put any paper product into the toilet bowl besides toilet tissue. Paper towels can rapidly stop up the toilet drain line or trigger a clog further down the drain. Feminine hygiene products should be gotten rid of in the garbage and never ever in the toilet.</p>
<p>A permit is likewise required to reconnect electrical or gas service to a residence. If the utility has actually been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months, reconnect permits are needed.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

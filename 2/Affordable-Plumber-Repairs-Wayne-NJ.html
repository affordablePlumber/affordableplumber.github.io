<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>

<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Sewage systems, drains and waste piping are checked for proper grading to keep down circulation. The plumbing system is tested for leaks.

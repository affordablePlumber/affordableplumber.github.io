<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions.

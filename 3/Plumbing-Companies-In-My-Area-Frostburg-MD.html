<h3>Blocked Drains in Frostburg MD 21532 - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Set up 40 gallon electrical hot water heater and thermal expansion tank. At Premier Plumbing we assist you make the best choice based your needs so you know that the water heater you buy is the right one for your home or business at the lowest cost possible. Clogged Toilet: For toilets that are terribly clogged, we will snake the drain to eliminate it at last.</p>

Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working correctly. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.

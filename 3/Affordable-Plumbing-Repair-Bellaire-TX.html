<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and changed with new rubber parts. It is necessary that just initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable water system within a building these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is set up.

Correct care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>

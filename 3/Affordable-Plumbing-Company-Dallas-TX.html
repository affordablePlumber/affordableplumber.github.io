The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water providers supervise these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear, or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed.

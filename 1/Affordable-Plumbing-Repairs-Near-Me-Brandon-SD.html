<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through. The pipes frequently make weird gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe since of the tight space. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the weird sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low.

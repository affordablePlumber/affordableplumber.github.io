<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping).

Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically restore after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>

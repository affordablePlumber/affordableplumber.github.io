If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem.

Links that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>

They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

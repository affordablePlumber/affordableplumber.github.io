<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible option, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>

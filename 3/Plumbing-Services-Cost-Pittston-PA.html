<p>No other room in a home includes as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have cleaned up and inspected the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly process. Some designs need the components to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each part is returned into the body, it is essential to put them back in the proper location. It is likewise essential that as they are positioned back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the elements or inadvertently placed in the body. The elements must be put so that the guides are able to maintain their created tolerances.</p>
<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new system in.

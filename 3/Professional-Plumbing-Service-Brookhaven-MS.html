<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our presentation. The steps for changing a gas hot water heater are exactly the exact same, and those for an electrical hot water heater are comparable. Repeating repairs and leaks. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As an outcome, we suggest replacing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might need somewhat various actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

A backflow prevention assembly includes an inlet and outlet turned off, properly situated test cocks, and the needed parts of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each part can even more be broken down into its parts. For example a first check belongs. An element can even more be broken down into its specific parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make components, and elements are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>

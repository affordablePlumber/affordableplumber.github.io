<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Garner NC</h3>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of warm water is the most significant sign that there is something wrong with your San Antonio water heater. If you aren't getting sufficient warm water for your shower, then you may have sediment that has actually developed in the unit and separated the water from the heat source. It's time to seek advice from the specialists if your water heater isn't doing its only job.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

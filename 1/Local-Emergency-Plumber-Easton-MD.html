<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

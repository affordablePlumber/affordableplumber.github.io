<p>If your old sink flange is tight and intact, without any signs of leakage, you can probably leave it in place. Chances are great that the installing brackets on the new system will fit simply fine. To learn, get rid of the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>There are two types of water softeners, a salt based water softener and a salt-free water softener Salt based water softeners will give you more of the slick" sensation in the shower and you will observe the soap developing more bubbles. Other advantages you will see include brighter colors in your clothing, minimized scale build-up on your showers and softer skin.</p>

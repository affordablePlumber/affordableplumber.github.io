<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized.

<p>Hot water heater failures trigger countless dollars in water damages every year. Remember that when selecting your new commercial water heater, you get what you pay for. While seemingly a deal, a hot water heater ranked for only 7 years is frequently most likely to fail before you recoup your financial investment.

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for at least half of the plumbing emergency situations that we run into in your houses around the Bay Area. The initial problems that occur are the discoloration of the water, with brown water coming out of a faucet that may have a nasty smell. It can also cause discolorations in clothes put in the washing machine. If your home is over 50 years old, it's an excellent bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Continuous obstructions: If the plunger has actually become a regular fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous clogs indicate your toilet no longer has the power needed to successfully eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a major consider impacted sewer lines. Tree roots grow in several directions and can get very large causing invasion of the lines underground.

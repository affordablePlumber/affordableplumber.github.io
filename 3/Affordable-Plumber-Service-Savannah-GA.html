We now have cleaned up and examined the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now ready to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some models need the elements to be eliminated in a particular order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each part is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the appropriate location.

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

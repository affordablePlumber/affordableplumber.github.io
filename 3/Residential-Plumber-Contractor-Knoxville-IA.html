If you need a brand-new toilet, the cost mostly depends upon the toilet you select. Toilets differ in design, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more expensive than others.

Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working appropriately. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality.

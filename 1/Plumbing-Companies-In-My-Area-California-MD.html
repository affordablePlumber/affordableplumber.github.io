<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>

<p>This is another mix that can work on sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this procedure if it doesn't work the very first time.

The thermal expansion needs to leave, hence the need for a growth tank to assist manage the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>

<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. The majority of kitchen sink clogs are due to heavy grease accumulation and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the garbage and utilize the disposal for the small particles that are left. Run cold water while running the disposal and you can count on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains.

When turned on the motor impellers and spins-- likewise called lugs-- throw littles food against a mill ring. You must always run water while utilizing the garbage disposal; when the waste disposal unit does its task, the water flushes the finely sliced particles down the drain.</p>

This makes it easier for the system to break them up. At Timothy Off, our clients in the West Chester area and beyond have always turned to us for quality HEATING AND COOLING and plumbing services. We're proud to say that when it pertains to residential and commercial hot water heater installation, we're also one of the very best in the area.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>

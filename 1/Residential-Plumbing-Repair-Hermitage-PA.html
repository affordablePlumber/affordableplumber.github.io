<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending upon the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again crucial for the repair professional to be aware of the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not harmful. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to reduce any scale development or rust. It is necessary that the repair professional is delicate to the firmness and type of the different coatings utilized on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective coating.</p>

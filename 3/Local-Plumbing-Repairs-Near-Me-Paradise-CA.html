<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>

<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex scientific process, however simple to correct. It utilizes salt to remove minerals and odors discovered in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and attract salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>

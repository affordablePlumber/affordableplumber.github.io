<p>Run the warm water. Warm water is your good friend, specifically for your kitchen sink. Even if you are extremely cautious with what you put down your sinks, food remnants and cooking oils still escape down our drains - especially the kitchen sink.

<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it doesn't necessarily mean they need to be changed. Well-maintained pipes may last longer, and poorly preserved ones or those in locations with difficult water (meaning it has high mineral material), might stop working sooner, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life-span estimates.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent.

This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

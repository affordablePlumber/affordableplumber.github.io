When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply.

<p>Homeowners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is particularly sensible to set up inspections on a yearly basis and when acquiring a brand-new house. A gas line pressure test is covered in a plumbers service call charge or a flat rate of $75 to $150. Some locations need an extensive 12 to 24-hour test, which costs between $150 and $500.

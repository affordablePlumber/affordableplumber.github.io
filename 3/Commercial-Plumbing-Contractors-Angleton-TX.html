Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

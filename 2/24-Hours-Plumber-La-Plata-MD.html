<p>Backflow preventers are likewise required by the plumbing code. Except within Shoreline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities clients is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Coastline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limitations. When it comes to backflow preventer requirements, Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline.</p>
<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it doesn't necessarily indicate they need to be replaced. Well-maintained pipes might last longer, and improperly preserved ones or those in locations with difficult water (meaning it has high mineral content), may stop working earlier, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the life-span estimates.</p>
<p>It's not a requirement, but a waste disposal unit will make life in your Chicago area house easier. Sending scraps of food down the drain produces quicker clean up after meals and less (potentially foul-smelling) waste in your garbage can. The benefits of including a garbage disposal to your kitchen sink will be obvious when you have actually used it for a couple of days.</p>

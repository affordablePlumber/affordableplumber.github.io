If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

<p>A recently installed water heater should not produce strange sounds, but it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things intensify dramatically for homes with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>

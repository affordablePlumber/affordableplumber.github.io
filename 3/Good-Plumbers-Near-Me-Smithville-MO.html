<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll have to replace it. Although any broken device is irritating to deal with, the good news is that setting up a replacement disposal will be cheaper than setting up a new waste disposal unit in a sink that has never ever had one in the past. Depending on the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the price.</p>

In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in residences were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

Continuous clogs suggest your toilet no longer has the power needed to efficiently get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's ended up being bothersome, or just for a new look? How about for a structure addition or major remodel? Once once again, that's something you could do yourself, although it's generally much better to work with a knowledgeable sink plumber in the San Diego area.

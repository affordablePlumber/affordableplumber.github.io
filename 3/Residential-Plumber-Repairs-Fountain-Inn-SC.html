This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>

<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

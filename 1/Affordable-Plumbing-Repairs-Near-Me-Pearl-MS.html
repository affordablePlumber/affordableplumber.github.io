<p>Water softeners include value to your operation by securing your water-using equipment from bad efficiency and premature failure. Some hard water problems are very noticeable, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater components and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Undetectable or noticeable, these problems have genuine expenses connected with them. Clogged components trigger replacement or refurbishing expenses and can frustrate your clients. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses. Soon, these little costs can amount to make a genuine impact on your bottom line.</p>

The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were allowed to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Usually, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>

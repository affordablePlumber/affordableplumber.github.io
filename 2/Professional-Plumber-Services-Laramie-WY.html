Here are a couple of complicated truths that frequently lead people to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is normally destructive. For that reason, softened water must likewise be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions.

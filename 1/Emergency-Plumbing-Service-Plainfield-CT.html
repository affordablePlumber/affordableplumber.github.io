It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly.

<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers oversee these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear, or tiredness.

Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be tested with effectively adjusted gauge equipment.</p>

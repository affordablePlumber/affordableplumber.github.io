It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

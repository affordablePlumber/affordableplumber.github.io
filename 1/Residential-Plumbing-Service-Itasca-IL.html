<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Itasca IL</h3>
<p>The standard work week for plumbers is 40 hours (8 hours a day, 5 days a week). As with lots of professions in construction, there are peak durations that will need you to work overtime. The number of additional hours you work each week depends on the building and construction sector and region you operate in, and will vary from one job to the next. With time, the limescale accumulation brought on by hard water can lead to expensive plumbing repairs. A RainSoft water conditioner can help avoid early wear and tear on your toilet.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Wellington CO 80549</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>

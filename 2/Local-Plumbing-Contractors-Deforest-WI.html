<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Deforest WI</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places.

Assemblies not currently noted should have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>

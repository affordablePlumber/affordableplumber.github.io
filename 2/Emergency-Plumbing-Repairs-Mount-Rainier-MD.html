<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Pests. Unfortunately, a damaged main sewer line can likewise lead to undesirable pests inside your home. Insects and rats can quickly squeeze through cracks and spaces in your sewer line and find their way into your plumbing. These insects can be very hazardous to your health. If you think you have bugs in your plumbing, a plumber can perform a visual inspection of your sewer line.</p>

You'll avoid the cost of plumbing repairs and excess water costs as well as improving the effectiveness of your house when you repipe your home. Permits and inspections: Online permits will continue to be released. Paper permit applications are processed every Tuesday. Inspections continue throughout regular hours by contacting your local plumbing inspector.</p>

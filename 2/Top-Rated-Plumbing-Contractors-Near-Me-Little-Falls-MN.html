<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>

<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>

<p>You see rust in your water: If you start to see rust in your water, it could be an indication that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. When pipes have ended up being corroded, Rust frequently seeps into the water supply. Although rust isn't inherently hazardous for your health, it can be an indicator of problem to come.

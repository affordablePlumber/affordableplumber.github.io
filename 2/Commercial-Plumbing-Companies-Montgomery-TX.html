<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Montgomery TX 77356</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>

After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from deterioration and may put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise replacing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

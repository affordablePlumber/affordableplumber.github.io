<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage problems. Once a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to eliminate any stuck-on debris. Put hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the waste disposal unit to eliminate grease. Another excellent technique is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>

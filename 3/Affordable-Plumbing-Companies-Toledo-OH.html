The preliminary problems that happen are the discoloration of the water, with brown water coming out of a faucet that might have a foul odor. It can also trigger stains in clothes put in the washing machine. If your home is over 50 years old, it's a great bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
